# Fire Alarm Systems 🚨

## Fire Alarm System Types

### Conventional Systems
- Zones of devices
- Identifies zone, not specific device
- Cost-effective for smaller buildings
- Simpler installation

### Addressable Systems
- Each device has unique address
- Pinpoint exact device in alarm
- More complex programming
- Better for large buildings

### Wireless Systems
- No wiring between devices
- Easier retrofit installations
- Battery powered devices
- Regular battery maintenance needed

---

## Fire Alarm Components

### Control Panel
- Central processing unit
- Monitors all devices
- Activates alarms
- Connects to monitoring service

### Initiating Devices
- **Smoke detectors**: Ionization or photoelectric
- **Heat detectors**: Fixed temperature or rate-of-rise
- **Manual pull stations**: Break glass or lever
- **Duct detectors**: HVAC smoke detection
- **Beam detectors**: Long-range smoke detection

### Notification Devices
- **Horns**: Audible alarms
- **Strobes**: Visual alarms (ADA required)
- **Horn/strobe combinations**: Dual notification
- **Speaker systems**: Voice evacuation

### Auxiliary Devices
- Automatic door releases
- Elevator recall
- HVAC shutdown
- Fire suppression activation

---

## Installation Requirements

### Code Compliance
- Follow NFPA 72 (National Fire Alarm Code)
- Local fire codes and amendments
- ADA accessibility requirements
- Building code requirements

### Device Placement
- Smoke detectors on ceilings or high on walls
- Spacing per manufacturer and code (typically 30 ft)
- Heat detectors in areas unsuitable for smoke
- Pull stations at exits (within 5 ft of door)
- Strobes visible from all areas

### Wiring
- Fire-rated cable (FPLR, FPLP)
- Proper support and protection
- Separate from power wiring
- Circuit supervision (end-of-line resistors)
- Color-coded (red jackets common)

---

## Testing and Inspection

### Installation Testing
- Continuity testing
- Voltage verification
- Device functionality
- System programming
- Full system test

### Periodic Testing
- Annual inspections required
- Semi-annual testing
- Monthly visual checks
- Battery testing
- Sensitivity testing for detectors

---

## Documentation

- As-built drawings
- Device locations
- Circuit layouts
- Test reports
- Inspection records
- Maintenance logs

---

## Integration

### Building Systems
- HVAC shutdown
- Elevator control
- Door access
- Sprinkler systems
- Emergency lighting

### Monitoring
- Central station monitoring
- Emergency services notification
- Building management systems
- Remote monitoring capabilities

---

## Maintenance

- Replace smoke detectors every 10 years
- Test system per schedule
- Replace batteries as needed
- Clean detectors regularly
- Update programming when building changes

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Fire alarm systems save lives
- Strict code compliance required
- Professional installation essential
- Regular testing and maintenance mandatory
- Proper documentation critical
- Integration with building systems important
