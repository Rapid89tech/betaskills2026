# Competitive Analysis (Pricing, Positioning, Differentiation)

Competitive analysis helps you avoid entering a market with no room to win. The goal is to find a clear way to differentiate.

## What to analyze

- Price range (in rands)
- Shipping cost and delivery time
- Product quality signals (photos, video, packaging)
- Reviews: what customers love and hate
- Bundles and upsells

## Where to look

- Marketplace listings and reviews
- Social media comments
- Google business reviews
- Competitor websites

## Differentiation ideas

- Better photos/videos and clearer descriptions
- Faster shipping or better packaging
- Stronger guarantees/returns
- Bundles that solve the full problem
- A niche focus (specific audience, style, or use case)

## Quick competitor scorecard

Rate 1–5:

- Product quality
- Trust (reviews, UGC)
- Price/value
- Delivery experience
- Brand clarity

Then choose your “win strategy”:

- Cheapest isn’t always best—aim for the clearest value.
