# Chemical Processes in Hairdressing

## Introduction

Chemical processes in hairdressing are transformative techniques that allow stylists to reshape, smooth, or correct hair to meet clients' aesthetic goals. These processes, including perming, relaxing, keratin treatments, smoothing systems, and color correction, rely on a deep understanding of hair structure and chemistry to achieve safe, effective, and long-lasting results. Mastering these techniques is essential for professional hairdressers, as they enable the creation of diverse styles while maintaining hair health. This lecture explores the science, application, and best practices for these processes, equipping participants with the knowledge to perform them confidently and professionally.

## Perming and Relaxing Hair

Perming is a chemical process that restructures the hair's protein bonds to create curls or waves, offering clients a way to transform their natural texture. The process begins with winding the hair onto perm rods, which determine the curl pattern. A waving lotion, typically alkaline or acid-based, is applied to break the disulfide bonds within the hair's keratin structure, allowing the hair to mold into the shape of the rods. After reshaping, a neutralizer is applied to reform the bonds, locking in the new curl pattern and restoring the hair's pH balance.

To ensure a successful perm, stylists must assess the hair's health, porosity, and elasticity, as damaged or overly porous hair may not respond well to the process. Timing is critical—over-processing can weaken the hair, leading to breakage or uneven curls. Conducting a strand test before starting helps predict the outcome and avoid damage. Using high-quality products and adhering to manufacturer guidelines ensures consistent results. Clients should be educated on post-perm care, such as using sulfate-free shampoos and avoiding heat styling to maintain the curl integrity. For further learning, videos like Getting A Perm: Perm 101 & My Experience by Tayla Davis provide practical insights into the perming process.

### Relaxing Hair

Relaxing is a chemical treatment designed to straighten curly or textured hair by permanently altering its disulfide bonds. Relaxers, such as sodium hydroxide (lye-based) or calcium hydroxide (no-lye), work by breaking these bonds, allowing the hair to be smoothed into a straighter form. The process involves applying the relaxer evenly, avoiding direct scalp contact to prevent irritation, and smoothing the hair to achieve the desired straightness. Thorough rinsing and neutralization are critical to stop the chemical reaction and prevent over-processing, which can cause scalp burns or hair damage.

Key considerations include evaluating the hair's condition and any prior chemical treatments, as overlapping relaxers on previously treated hair can lead to breakage. Scalp sensitivity and precise timing are also crucial to avoid irritation or uneven results. Post-relaxer treatments, such as protein conditioners and moisturizing products, help restore the hair's strength and hydration. Best practices include performing a patch test, neutralizing thoroughly, and advising clients on maintenance routines to keep relaxed hair healthy. Resources like Healthy Relaxed Hair! How to Properly Apply a Relaxer & Neutralize offer detailed demonstrations of the relaxing process.

## Keratin Treatments and Smoothing Systems

### Keratin Treatments

Keratin treatments infuse the hair with keratin, a natural protein, to reduce frizz, enhance manageability, and add shine. The process involves applying a keratin-based solution to clean, dry hair, followed by heat sealing with a flat iron to lock the protein into the hair shaft. This treatment smooths the hair cuticle, making it more resistant to humidity and easier to style. Benefits include reduced styling time, improved hair texture, and results that last from several weeks to months, depending on the product and aftercare.

However, some keratin formulas contain formaldehyde or similar compounds, which may pose health risks if not handled properly. Results also vary by hair type—coarser or highly textured hair may require stronger formulations. Professional application is essential to achieve optimal results and minimize risks. Stylists should consult clients about their hair history and goals, follow product instructions meticulously, and recommend sulfate-free shampoos to prolong the treatment's effects. Videos such as Keratin Hair Treatment | Pros & Cons Keratin provide a comprehensive overview of the process and its outcomes.

### Smoothing Systems

Smoothing systems are non-permanent treatments designed to reduce frizz, enhance shine, and improve hair texture without fully altering the natural curl pattern. Unlike keratin treatments or relaxers, smoothing systems offer temporary results, typically lasting several weeks, making them ideal for clients seeking less commitment. These treatments are gentler, suitable for a wide range of hair types, and often use plant-based or organic ingredients to nourish the hair while smoothing the cuticle.

Best practices include performing a patch test to check for sensitivities and discussing the client's expectations, as smoothing systems may not deliver the same dramatic results as relaxers or keratin treatments. Maintenance products, such as leave-in conditioners and anti-frizz serums, help extend the treatment's benefits. Resources like BIOsmooth | Organic Smoothing System - Step by Step demonstrate the application process and highlight the benefits of these gentler treatments.

## Color Correction Techniques

Color correction is the art of fixing unwanted hair color outcomes, such as brassy tones, uneven application, or incorrect shades. This complex process often requires multiple steps and sessions to achieve a balanced, natural result while preserving hair health. Common issues include brassy or warm tones, which can be neutralized with blue or purple-based toners to counteract orange or yellow undertones. Overly dark hair may require gradual lightening with a gentle lightener, while overly light hair may need a filler to ensure even color absorption when darkening. Uneven color can be addressed by sectioning the hair and layering glazes or toners for seamless blending, while faded or patchy color benefits from semi-permanent glosses and deep conditioning to ensure even application.

A thorough consultation is the foundation of successful color correction. Stylists must understand the client's hair history, including previous color applications and chemical treatments, to avoid further damage. Working in stages prevents over-processing, and using high-quality, gentle products helps maintain hair integrity. Strand tests are essential to predict how the hair will respond to corrective treatments. Resources like COLOR CORRECTION 101 | BEAUTY SCHOOL SERIES offer practical guidance for mastering these techniques.
