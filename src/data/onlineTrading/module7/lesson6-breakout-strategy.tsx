            Breakout strategy identifies and trades significant price movements when assets breach established support or resistance levels signalling potential strong trends beginning like stocks surging on earnings beats or forex pairs breaking ranges on news blending confirmation with momentum for entering positions early in new directions powering reliable captures of large moves without waiting inside consolidations common in range-bound waiting. This approach suits volatile instruments reacting to catalysts where traders buy above resistance in uptrends or sell below support in downtrends using volume spikes or candle closes confirming validity without false breaks trapping prematurely—this opportunistic method contrasts trend-following riding established moves by focusing on initiation points often with tighter initial stops preventing large losses if fakeouts occur, delivering dynamic participation that capitalises on volatility expansions without passive holding through quiet periods in varied market conditions demanding organised breakout identification for disciplined enduring trading without chasing extended trends or ignoring reversals regionally.
