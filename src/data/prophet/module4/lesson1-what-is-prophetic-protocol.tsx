# What is Prophetic Protocol?

Prophetic protocol refers to the biblical principles, order, and boundaries that guide prophetic activity within the local church, ensuring that prophecy aligns with God's will and fosters spiritual growth. Grounded in scriptures like 1 Corinthians 14:40, which states, "Let all things be done decently and in order," prophetic protocol provides a framework for exercising prophetic gifts or roles with integrity, humility, and respect.

> "Let all things be done decently and in order." — 1 Corinthians 14:40

## Purpose of Prophetic Protocol

### 1. God is Glorified, Not the Prophet

Prophetic protocol ensures that prophetic words point to God's glory, not the prophet's personal recognition, reflecting humility and submission to the Holy Spirit.

**Biblical Example:** John the Baptist declared, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30), ensuring his prophetic ministry glorified Jesus.

**Practical Tip:** Deliver prophetic messages with humility, crediting God and avoiding self-promotion, especially on digital platforms.

### 2. The Church is Edified, Not Confused

Protocol ensures prophetic words build up, encourage, and comfort the church (1 Corinthians 14:3), preventing confusion or division through orderly delivery.

**Biblical Example:** Agabus' prophecy about Paul's imprisonment (Acts 21:10–11) was clear and orderly, guiding the church without causing chaos.

**Practical Tip:** Structure prophetic contributions in services to avoid disruption, ensuring clarity and edification for all.

### 3. Leaders are Respected, Not Undermined

Prophetic protocol requires submission to church leadership, respecting their authority and fostering unity, as encouraged in Hebrews 13:17.

**Biblical Example:** Paul submitted his ministry to church leaders in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1–2), ensuring his prophetic guidance aligned with apostolic authority.

**Practical Tip:** Share prophetic words with leaders privately before public delivery to maintain respect and unity.

## Key Principles of Prophetic Protocol

### 1. Orderly Conduct

Prophetic activity should follow biblical guidelines for worship, ensuring it is structured and respectful, as Paul instructs in 1 Corinthians 14:29–33: "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said."

**Practical Tip:** Coordinate with church leadership to determine appropriate times and settings for sharing prophetic words.

### 2. Submission to Leadership

Prophets must submit to spiritual oversight, allowing leaders to test and guide their words to ensure alignment with scripture and church vision.

**Practical Tip:** Present prophetic messages to pastors or elders for discernment before sharing publicly, fostering accountability.

### 3. Focus on Edification

Prophetic words should strengthen, encourage, and comfort the church, aligning with 1 Corinthians 14:3, rather than causing fear or confusion.

**Practical Tip:** Frame prophetic messages with love and clarity, ensuring they build up the congregation.

### 4. Humility and Accountability

Prophets must remain humble, acknowledging their dependence on the Holy Spirit and submitting to correction, as advised in 1 Thessalonians 5:20–21.

**Practical Tip:** Seek feedback from trusted leaders to test prophetic words, maintaining humility and accountability.

### 5. Scriptural Alignment

Prophetic messages must align with scripture, as 2 Timothy 3:16–17 emphasizes its authority for teaching and correction.

**Practical Tip:** Cross-reference prophetic words with scripture to ensure they reflect God's truth, avoiding personal bias.

## Consequences of Ignoring Prophetic Protocol

- **Glorifying the Prophet:** Without humility, prophets may seek personal recognition, leading to division
- **Church Confusion:** Disorderly prophecy disrupts worship, causing confusion rather than edification
- **Undermining Leadership:** Ignoring leaders risks rebellion, fracturing church unity
