# Commercial Electrical Installations 🏢

## Commercial vs Residential

### Key Differences
- Higher voltage systems (208V, 240V, 480V)
- Three-phase power
- Larger loads and circuits
- More complex installations
- Stricter code requirements
- Conduit instead of NM cable

## Commercial Wiring Methods

### Conduit Systems
- EMT for most installations
- Rigid conduit for outdoor/exposed
- PVC for underground
- Flexible for motors and equipment

### Wire Types
- THHN/THWN in conduit
- MC cable in some applications
- Larger wire sizes (6 AWG and up common)

## Commercial Circuits

### Lighting
- Fluorescent and LED fixtures
- Occupancy sensors
- Daylight harvesting
- Emergency lighting
- Exit signs

### Power Distribution
- 120V single-phase for offices
- 208V/240V for equipment
- 480V for large motors
- Three-phase for balanced loads

### Special Systems
- Fire alarm systems
- Security systems
- Data/communication cabling
- Access control
- HVAC controls

## Installation Procedures

### 1. Layout and Planning
- Review commercial blueprints
- Coordinate with other trades
- Plan conduit routes
- Schedule work phases

### 2. Rough-In
- Install conduit systems
- Pull wire
- Install boxes and panels
- Rough-in for equipment

### 3. Trim-Out
- Install devices
- Connect fixtures
- Label circuits
- Test systems

### 4. Final
- Complete all connections
- Install covers
- Panel labeling
- System testing

## Safety Considerations
- Higher voltages more dangerous
- Arc flash risks greater
- Use proper PPE
- Follow LOTO procedures
- Coordinate with facility operations

## 💡 Key Points
- Commercial work more complex than residential
- Three-phase power common
- Conduit required for most installations
- Coordination with other trades essential
- Safety protocols critical
