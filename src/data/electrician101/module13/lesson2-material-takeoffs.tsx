# Material Takeoffs 📊

## Takeoff Process

### Preparation
- Obtain complete drawings
- Verify drawing scale
- Get specifications
- Note special requirements
- Organize workspace

### Systematic Approach
1. Start with one system at a time
2. Work through drawings page by page
3. Use color coding to track progress
4. Count carefully and consistently
5. Double-check quantities

## Counting Techniques

### Wire and Cable
- Measure distances on drawings
- Apply scale factor
- Add for vertical runs
- Include waste factor (10-15%)
- Round up to next standard length
- Group by size and type

### Conduit
- Measure runs on drawings
- Add for fittings and turns
- Include rise to devices
- Waste factor for cutting (10%)
- List fittings separately

### Devices and Fixtures
- Count each symbol
- Group by type
- Include boxes and covers
- Note special devices separately
- Create device schedule

---

## Waste Factors

### Typical Percentages
- Wire: 10-15%
- Conduit: 10%
- Fittings: 5%
- Devices: 5%
- Miscellaneous: 10%

### Reasons for Waste
- Cutting to length
- Damaged materials
- Incorrect measurements
- Design changes
- Learning curve

---

## Organizing Takeoff

### Categories
- Service and panels
- Branch circuit wiring
- Lighting
- Devices (outlets, switches)
- Special systems
- Conduit and fittings
- Boxes and supports

### Spreadsheet Format
- Item description
- Unit of measure
- Quantity
- Unit cost
- Extended cost
- Subtotals by category

---

## Special Considerations

### Labor-Intensive Items
- Note complex installations
- Account for difficult access
- Include specialty items
- Flag items needing coordination

### Long-Lead Items
- Identify custom equipment
- Note delivery times
- Plan procurement schedule
- Confirm availability

---

## Digital Takeoff Tools

### On-Screen Takeoff
- Import PDF drawings
- Count and measure digitally
- Automatic scaling
- Export to estimating software
- Reduces errors

### Advantages
- Faster than manual
- More accurate
- Easy to revise
- Creates audit trail
- Professional appearance

---

## Checking Your Work

### Verification
- Review counts systematically
- Cross-check related items
- Verify scale accuracy
- Compare to similar projects
- Have second person review

### Common Errors
- Wrong scale applied
- Missed pages or sheets
- Double counting
- Incorrect units
- Math errors
