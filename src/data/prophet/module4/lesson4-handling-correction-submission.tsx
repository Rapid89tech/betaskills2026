# Handling Correction and Submission in Prophetic Ministry

Handling correction and submission is a vital aspect of prophetic ministry, ensuring that prophets—whether exercising the spiritual gift (1 Corinthians 14:1) or serving in the office of the prophet (Ephesians 4:11)—operate with humility and integrity. True prophets must be teachable, receive feedback without retaliation, and recognize that humility builds spiritual credibility.

## Key Aspects of Handling Correction and Submission

### 1. Be Teachable and Receive Feedback

**Description:** True prophets must be open to learning and receiving constructive feedback from mature believers or leaders, allowing their words to be tested (1 Corinthians 14:29; 1 Thessalonians 5:20–21).

**Biblical Example:** Paul welcomed feedback from the apostles in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1–2), ensuring his prophetic guidance aligned with church doctrine.

**Significance:** Teachability prevents pride and error, ensuring prophetic messages reflect God's truth and edify the church.

**Practical Tip:** Actively seek feedback from trusted leaders or peers after sharing prophetic words, remaining open to correction and growth.

### 2. Never Retaliate or Withdraw When Corrected

**Description:** Prophets must avoid defensiveness, retaliation, or withdrawal when corrected, responding with grace and humility to maintain unity and credibility (Proverbs 15:31–32).

**Biblical Example:** Jeremiah accepted persecution and correction without retaliation (Jeremiah 26:12–15), humbly continuing his prophetic ministry.

**Significance:** A non-defensive response preserves relationships and demonstrates maturity, fostering trust in prophetic ministry.

**Practical Tip:** When corrected, pray for humility and respond with gratitude, avoiding isolation or resentment to maintain spiritual health.

### 3. Understand That Humility Builds Spiritual Credibility

**Description:** Humility in accepting correction and submitting to authority builds trust and credibility, reflecting God's character and aligning with 1 Peter 5:5–6: "Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility."

**Biblical Example:** Nathan humbly delivered correction to David (2 Samuel 12:1–7), earning respect and ensuring his prophetic words carried weight.

**Significance:** Humility validates a prophet's ministry, showing their reliance on the Holy Spirit and commitment to God's glory.

**Practical Tip:** Cultivate humility through prayer and accountability, recognizing that credibility comes from aligning with God's will, not personal recognition.

## Consequences of Failing to Handle Correction and Submission

- **Division in the Church:** Retaliation or rebellion undermines leadership, causing division
- **Loss of Credibility:** Withdrawing or rejecting feedback erodes trust, weakening the prophet's ministry
- **Harm to the Church:** Uncorrected errors can confuse or wound believers
