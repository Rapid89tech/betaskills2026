* **Use**: Prevents cuts, burns, chemical exposure, or vibration injuries.
* **Example**: Wear cut-resistant gloves (ANSI A4 or higher) when handling sharp tools.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect for tears or wear; clean or replace as needed.

### 6. Foot and Leg Protection

* **Equipment**: Steel-toed boots, metatarsal guards, chaps.
* **Use**: Protects against falling objects, punctures, or slips.
* **Example**: Wear slip-resistant steel-toed boots (ASTM F2413) on wet or uneven surfaces.
* **Maintenance**: Check for sole wear or damaged toe caps; replace when compromised.

### 7. Body Protection

* **Equipment**: High-visibility vests, aprons, flame-resistant clothing, full-body suits.
* **Use**: Shields against chemicals, heat, or low-visibility hazards.
* **Example**: Wear a high-visibility ANSI Class 2 vest when working near traffic.
* **Maintenance**: Wash regularly; inspect for tears or faded reflectivity.

### 8. Fall Protection

* **Equipment**: Harnesses, lanyards, anchor points.
* **Use**: Prevents falls from heights (e.g., roofs, scaffolds).
* **Example**: Use a full-body harness with a shock-absorbing lanyard when working above 6 feet.
* **Maintenance**: Inspect for fraying or damaged stitching; store in a dry place.

## Selecting the Right PPE

### Hazard Assessment

* Identify workplace risks (e.g., sharp objects, chemicals, noise) through a job safety analysis.
* Match PPE to specific hazards (e.g., chemical-resistant gloves for handling solvents).

### Fit and Comfort

* Ensure proper fit to maximize protection and usability (e.g., conduct respirator fit testing).
* Choose breathable or adjustable gear for prolonged use.

### Standards Compliance

* Select PPE meeting standards like OSHA 1910.132, ANSI, or ASTM.
* Example: Ensure hard hats meet ANSI Z89.1 Type I or II requirements.

### User Training

* Train workers on proper PPE use, limitations, and maintenance.
* Example: Demonstrate how to secure a harness correctly.

## Proper Use and Best Practices

### 1. Pre-Use Inspection

* Check PPE for damage, wear, or defects before each use.
* Example: Look for cracks in safety glasses or frayed harness straps.

### 2. Correct Application

* Wear PPE as intended (e.g., safety glasses over eyes, not on forehead).
* Ensure all components (e.g., harness anchors) are properly connected.

### 3. Consistent Use

* Wear PPE throughout exposure to hazards, even for short tasks.
* Example: Keep gloves on during entire cutting tasks.

### 4. Layering for Multiple Hazards

* Combine PPE types when needed (e.g., goggles and a face shield for welding).
* Ensure compatibility (e.g., avoid loose gloves with rotating machinery).

### 5. Hygiene and Cleaning

* Clean reusable PPE regularly (e.g., wash goggles with mild soap).
* Avoid sharing PPE to prevent cross-contamination.

## Maintenance and Storage
