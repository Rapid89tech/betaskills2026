# Taxes and Basic Legal Considerations

Understanding taxes and legal requirements is essential for running a compliant, sustainable online business. Proper tax management and legal compliance protect you from penalties, build customer trust, and create a solid foundation for growth.

While these topics may seem complex, breaking them into manageable steps makes compliance achievable for sellers at any stage.

## VAT Registration and Obligations

If your business turnover reaches the threshold where value-added tax registration becomes mandatory, you must register with the revenue authority and start charging VAT on taxable supplies.

This involves adding the standard VAT rate to your prices, issuing valid tax invoices to customers, and submitting regular returns while remitting the collected tax. Staying compliant avoids penalties and ensures your pricing reflects the true cost to customers, maintaining transparency in all transactions quoted in rands.

### VAT Registration Requirements

Mandatory Registration: Required when turnover exceeds R1 million in any 12-month period

Voluntary Registration: Can register voluntarily if turnover exceeds R50,000

Registration Process: Apply through SARS eFiling with business and banking details

VAT Number: Receive unique VAT number to display on invoices and website

Effective Date: VAT obligations begin from registration date

### VAT Rates in South Africa
- Standard rate: 15% on most goods and services
- Zero-rated: 0% on certain essentials (bread, milk, fresh produce)
- Exempt: No VAT charged (financial services, residential rent)

## Collecting and Remitting VAT Correctly

Once registered, accurately calculate VAT on every sale, clearly display whether prices include or exclude VAT on your website, and separate the VAT amount on invoices.

Keep detailed records of input VAT claimed on business expenses to offset against output VAT collected. Proper management here supports healthy cash flow and prevents unexpected liabilities during audits.

### VAT Management Best Practices

Price Display: Clearly state if prices include or exclude VAT

Invoice Requirements: Issue tax invoices with all required details (VAT number, amounts, date)

Input VAT Claims: Keep receipts for business expenses to claim input VAT

VAT Returns: Submit bi-monthly returns through SARS eFiling

Payment Timing: Pay VAT due within 25 days of return period end

Record Keeping: Maintain all VAT documentation for 5 years

### VAT Calculation Example
- Sale price: R1,150 (VAT inclusive)
- VAT amount: R150 (R1,150 / 1.15 x 0.15)
- Net amount: R1,000

## Income Tax Responsibilities

All business profits are subject to income tax, whether you operate as a sole proprietor, partnership, or company.

Maintain accurate financial records throughout the year, declare income honestly in annual returns, and make provisional tax payments if required. Deductible business expenses can lower your taxable income, so tracking them carefully maximizes legitimate relief and keeps you in good standing.

### Income Tax Obligations

Tax Registration: Register for income tax with SARS

Provisional Tax: Make bi-annual payments if tax liability exceeds R1,000

Annual Returns: Submit tax returns by deadline (typically February for individuals)

Tax Rates: Vary by business structure (individuals use progressive rates, companies pay 27%)

Deductible Expenses: Claim legitimate business costs to reduce taxable income

### Common Deductible Expenses
- Stock and materials
- Packaging and shipping supplies
- Marketing and advertising
- Website hosting and platform fees
- Home office portion (if applicable)
- Professional fees (accountant, lawyer)
- Business insurance
- Equipment and tools

## Choosing the Right Business Structure

Decide early whether to register as a sole proprietor, private company, or another entity, as this affects tax rates, personal liability, and administrative requirements.

A formal structure like a company offers limited liability protection but involves more compliance obligations. The choice impacts how profits are taxed and distributed, so align it with your growth plans and risk tolerance.

### Business Structure Options

Sole Proprietor: Simplest structure, you and business are one entity, personal liability for debts

Partnership: Two or more people share ownership, profits, and liability

Private Company (Pty Ltd): Separate legal entity, limited liability, more compliance requirements

Close Corporation (CC): Similar to company but simpler (no longer available for new registrations)

### Structure Comparison

Sole Proprietor:
- Easy and cheap to start
- Minimal compliance
- Personal tax rates apply
- Full personal liability
- Suitable for small, low-risk businesses

Private Company:
- Limited liability protection
- Corporate tax rate (27%)
- More credibility with suppliers/customers
- Higher compliance costs
- Better for growth and investment

## Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws

Adhere to regulations that require honest advertising, accurate product descriptions, and fair treatment of customers.

This includes honoring cooling-off periods for certain transactions, providing clear information about goods and services, and avoiding misleading claims. Following these rules builds customer trust and shields your business from complaints or penalties.

### Consumer Protection Act Requirements

Honest Advertising: No false or misleading claims about products

Accurate Descriptions: Product information must be truthful and complete

Fair Pricing: Display prices clearly, including all mandatory costs

Cooling-Off Period: 7-day return right for certain distance sales

Warranty Information: Clearly state warranty terms and conditions

Complaint Handling: Provide accessible channels for customer complaints

### Prohibited Practices
- Bait advertising (advertising unavailable products)
- False scarcity claims
- Hidden fees or charges
- Misleading comparisons
- Unfair contract terms

## Data Protection and Privacy Compliance

Handle customer personal information responsibly under relevant privacy laws, obtaining consent where needed and securing data against breaches.

Publish a clear privacy policy explaining how data is collected, used, and protected. Non-compliance can lead to serious fines and reputational damage, while strong practices reassure customers and support long-term relationships.

### POPIA Compliance (Protection of Personal Information Act)

Lawful Processing: Only collect and use data for legitimate purposes

Consent: Obtain clear consent for data collection and marketing

Data Minimization: Only collect necessary information

Security Measures: Protect data with appropriate technical safeguards

Access Rights: Allow customers to access, correct, or delete their data

Breach Notification: Report data breaches to authorities and affected individuals

### Privacy Policy Requirements

- Who you share it with
- How long you keep it
- Security measures in place
- Customer rights
- Contact information

## Clear Terms and Conditions

Develop comprehensive terms of service, including delivery details, warranty information, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution processes.

Make them easily accessible on your website and require acceptance at checkout. Well-drafted terms protect your business legally and set clear expectations, reducing disputes and potential claims.
