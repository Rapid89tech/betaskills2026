# Seasonal Maintenance Routines in Landscaping

Seasonal maintenance routines are essential for keeping landscapes healthy, functional, and visually appealing throughout the year. Tailored to climate, plant needs, and site conditions, these routines address tasks like planting, pruning, fertilizing, mowing, pest control, irrigation adjustments, and winterizing. This guide outlines comprehensive seasonal maintenance plans for a 50x30-foot residential backyard in Zone 7, with clay soil, a tall fescue lawn, a red maple tree, a lavender border, a 4x8-foot vegetable bed, a 10x10-foot permeable paver patio, a 6x4-foot garden pond, and a drip/sprinkler irrigation system.

## Spring (March–May)

Spring focuses on preparing the landscape for active growth, addressing soil health, planting, and system startup.

### Tasks

* **Site Assessment**:
  * Inspect for winter damage (e.g., frost heaving on patio, erosion near pond).
  * Test soil (pH, nutrients) and amend clay soil with 2–3 inches of compost for lawn and vegetable bed.
  * Example: Test backyard soil (pH 6.0, low nitrogen) and add 5 pounds of lime per 100 square feet.

* **Plant Maintenance**:
  * Prune red maple to remove dead or crossing branches (February–early March, before bud break).
  * Trim lavender lightly to shape, avoiding old wood.
  * Plant new perennials (e.g., hostas in shaded areas) and vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, basil in raised bed).
  * Example: Prune 10% of maple branches, plant tomatoes in the vegetable bed, and add hostas in the northwest corner.

* **Turf Maintenance**:
  * Mow tall fescue lawn weekly to 3 inches, starting when grass reaches 4 inches.
  * Apply pre-emergent herbicide to prevent crabgrass and 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer (10-10-10) per 1,000 square feet.
  * Aerate lawn to relieve clay soil compaction.
  * Example: Mow the 30x20-foot lawn weekly, apply herbicide in March, and aerate in April.

* **Irrigation**:
  * Start up irrigation system: check sprinkler heads and drip emitters for clogs, flush lines, and test the smart controller.
  * Set sprinklers for lawn (30 minutes, 2 times weekly, delivering 1 inch) and drip for plants (15 minutes daily, 1 GPH).
  * Example: Test and adjust sprinklers for even lawn coverage, flush drip lines for lavender and vegetable bed.

* **Pest Control**:
  * Monitor for aphids on lavender and grubs in the lawn; release ladybugs or use neem oil for aphids.
  * Inspect vegetables for early pests (e.g., tomato hornworms).
  * Example: Release ladybugs on lavender in April and check lawn for grub activity.

* **Hardscape and Water Features**:
  * Clean patio pavers with a pressure washer and check for loose joints; reseal if needed (every 2–3 years).
  * Remove debris from the pond, check pump and filter, and add beneficial bacteria to maintain water quality.
  * Example: Pressure-wash the patio in April and clean the pond pump in March.

* **Erosion and Drainage**:
  * Inspect swale near vegetable bed and French drain along north edge for debris; clear as needed.
  * Check riprap around pond for displacement and replenish mulch around lavender.
  * Example: Clear swale debris and add 1 inch of bark mulch to lavender border.

## Summer (June–August)

Summer maintenance focuses on sustaining growth, managing water needs, and controlling pests during peak heat.

### Tasks

* **Plant Maintenance**:
  * Deadhead lavender and hostas to encourage blooms; prune lightly to maintain shape.
  * Water maple deeply (1–2 inches weekly) during dry spells to support establishment.
  * Harvest vegetables and replant for succession crops (e.g., basil, peppers).
  * Example: Deadhead lavender weekly, water maple during drought, and plant peppers in July.

* **Turf Maintenance**:
  * Mow lawn weekly to 3 inches, raising to 3.5 inches in hot weather to reduce stress.
  * Water lawn 1 inch weekly via sprinkler, adjusting for rainfall.
  * Monitor for brown patch (fungal disease); apply fungicide if needed.
  * Example: Mow lawn weekly, adjust sprinklers for 1-inch delivery, and check for brown patch in July.

* **Irrigation**:
  * Monitor irrigation system weekly for leaks or clogs; adjust schedules for hotter weather (e.g., increase drip to 20 minutes daily for vegetables).
  * Check rain sensor functionality to avoid overwatering.
  * Example: Increase drip irrigation to 20 minutes daily for vegetable bed in July and test rain sensor.

* **Pest Control**:
  * Inspect for pests (e.g., aphids, spider mites on lavender; chinch bugs in lawn) and diseases (e.g., powdery mildew on vegetables).
  * Use neem oil or insecticidal soap for insects; hand-pick larger pests like hornworms.
  * Example: Apply neem oil to lavender for aphids and hand-pick hornworms from tomatoes.

* **Hardscape and Water Features**:
  * Sweep patio weekly to remove debris and check for weed growth between pavers.
  * Monitor pond for algae; add barley straw or a UV clarifier if needed.
  * Example: Sweep patio weekly and add barley straw to pond in June to control algae.

* **Erosion and Drainage**:
  * Check French drain and swale after heavy rains to ensure proper flow.
  * Replenish mulch around lavender and inspect riprap around pond.
  * Example: Clear French drain after storms and add mulch to lavender border in July.

## Fall (September–November)

Fall maintenance prepares the landscape for dormancy, focusing on cleanup, fertilization, and winterizing.

### Tasks

* **Plant Maintenance**:
  * Prune lavender by one-third after flowering (early September) to maintain shape.
  * Plant fall vegetables (e.g., kale, lettuce) in the vegetable bed.
  * Mulch around maple and lavender (2 inches) to insulate roots.
  * Example: Prune lavender in September, plant kale in the vegetable bed, and mulch around maple.

* **Turf Maintenance**:
  * Mow lawn weekly to 3 inches until growth slows (late October).
  * Apply 1 pound of nitrogen fertilizer (10-10-10) per 1,000 square feet and overseed bare patches.
  * Aerate lawn to improve winter resilience.
  * Example: Fertilize and overseed the lawn in October, aerate in September.

* **Irrigation**:
  * Reduce irrigation frequency as temperatures cool (e.g., lawn: 1 time weekly; plants: every 2 days).
  * Winterize system in late November: drain sprinklers, drip lines, and store controller components to prevent freezing in Zone 7.
  * Example: Reduce sprinkler schedule in October and drain system in November.

* **Pest Control**:
  * Monitor for late-season pests (e.g., grubs in lawn) and apply targeted treatments (e.g., beneficial nematodes).
  * Remove diseased plant debris to prevent overwintering pathogens.
  * Example: Apply nematodes to lawn in September and clear vegetable bed debris.

* **Hardscape and Water Features**:
  * Clean patio and check for settling pavers; relevel if needed.
  * Drain pond pump, clean filter, and add a pond heater to prevent freezing.
  * Example: Relevel patio pavers in October and install a pond heater in November.

* **Erosion and Drainage**:
  * Inspect French drain, swale, and riprap for debris or erosion after fall rains.
  * Add mulch to exposed soil areas to prevent winter erosion.
  * Example: Clear swale and add mulch around lavender in October.

## Winter (December–February)

Winter maintenance focuses on protection, cleanup, and planning for the next season in Zone 7's mild climate.

### Tasks

* **Plant Maintenance**:
  * Prune red maple in late February to remove dead branches, avoiding heavy cuts to prevent stress.
  * Check mulch levels around lavender and maple; add 1 inch if needed to insulate roots.
  * Example: Prune maple in February and add mulch around lavender in December.

* **Turf Maintenance**:
  * Suspend mowing as tall fescue goes dormant; remove debris (e.g., leaves) to prevent mold.
  * Apply a winter fertilizer (e.g., 0-0-20 for potassium) to strengthen roots.
  * Example: Rake leaves from lawn monthly and apply winter fertilizer in December.

* **Irrigation**:
  * Ensure irrigation system is fully drained and covered to prevent freeze damage.
  * Store controller and sensors indoors if removable.
  * Example: Cover exposed sprinkler heads and store controller in December.

* **Pest Control**:
  * Monitor for overwintering pests (e.g., scale on maple) and apply dormant oil in late winter.
  * Remove debris around plants to reduce pest habitats.
  * Example: Apply dormant oil to maple in February and clear debris around lavender.

* **Hardscape and Water Features**:
  * Inspect patio for frost heaving; relevel pavers if needed.
  * Monitor pond for ice; ensure heater is functioning and remove debris.
  * Example: Check patio for heaving in January and verify pond heater operation.

* **Erosion and Drainage**:
  * Inspect French drain and swale for blockages after winter storms.
  * Check riprap and mulch for displacement; replenish as needed.
  * Example: Clear French drain in January and add mulch to lavender border.
