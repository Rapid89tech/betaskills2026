# Why Character Matters in Prophetic Ministry

The gift of prophecy is a powerful tool for communicating God's will, but without godly character, it risks becoming ineffective or even harmful. As Jesus taught in Matthew 7:16, "You will know them by their fruits," a prophet's character is the foundation that ensures their message reflects God's heart and values.

> "You will know them by their fruits." — Matthew 7:16

## Why Character Matters in Prophetic Ministry

### 1. Reflecting God's Heart and Values

A prophet's character must mirror God's attributes—love, justice, humility, and truth—to authentically convey His message. Matthew 7:16–20 emphasizes that true prophets are known by their "fruits," or godly conduct.

**Biblical Example:** Jeremiah's integrity and obedience (Jeremiah 1:4–10) ensured his prophecies of judgment and restoration reflected God's heart, despite personal hardship.

**Practical Tip:** Cultivate virtues like humility and compassion through prayer and scripture to ensure prophetic words align with God's character.

### 2. Ensuring Credibility and Trust

Godly character builds trust among the church and leaders, validating the prophet's message. Poor character, such as pride or deceit, undermines credibility and causes division.

**Biblical Example:** Nathan's humble correction of David (2 Samuel 12:1–7) was effective because his character lent authority to his words.

**Practical Tip:** Maintain accountability with mature believers to uphold integrity and foster trust in prophetic ministry.

### 3. Preventing Distortion of God's Message

Poor character, such as selfish ambition or lack of discernment, can distort prophetic messages, leading to confusion or harm. A prophet's life must align with their words to reflect God's truth.

**Biblical Example:** False prophets in Jeremiah's time (Jeremiah 23:16–17) spoke from their own minds, misleading Israel due to their lack of godly character.

**Practical Tip:** Test prophetic words against scripture (1 John 4:1) and seek the Holy Spirit's guidance to ensure purity of motive.

### 4. Protecting the Church from Harm

A prophet with poor character risks misleading the church, causing spiritual or emotional harm. Godly character ensures messages edify, as Paul notes in 1 Corinthians 14:3.

**Biblical Example:** Elijah's faithfulness (1 Kings 18:36–38) protected Israel from idolatry, while false prophets led people astray (1 Kings 22:11–12).

**Practical Tip:** Deliver prophetic words with love and humility to build up, not tear down, the body of Christ.

### 5. Modeling Christ's Example

Prophets are called to reflect Jesus, the ultimate prophet (Hebrews 1:1–2), whose character embodied humility, love, and obedience (Philippians 2:5–8).

**Biblical Example:** Jesus' prophetic teachings (Matthew 5–7) were powerful because His life perfectly reflected God's heart.

**Practical Tip:** Emulate Jesus' humility by prioritizing God's glory over personal recognition in prophetic ministry.

## Consequences of Poor Character

- **Misleading Others:** Selfish or prideful prophets may deliver false or self-serving messages, as warned in Jeremiah 23:16
- **Division in the Church:** Lack of integrity can cause confusion or factions, undermining unity (Ephesians 4:13)
- **Loss of Credibility:** Dishonesty or hypocrisy erodes trust, as seen with false prophets in Ezekiel 13:1–9
- **Spiritual Harm:** Poor character can lead to harmful guidance, as when false prophets misled Israel into idolatry (1 Kings 22:22–23)
