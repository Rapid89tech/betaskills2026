            Revenge trading emerges as a destructive emotional response in trading psychology where losses trigger impulsive aggressive follow-up trades aimed at quickly recovering capital without proper analysis or risk controls blending frustration with desperation for immediate redemption powering escalated risks that often compound setbacks reliably without rational strategy guiding actions. This reactive behaviour typically follows a losing trade prompting larger sizes or riskier entries ignoring setups like chasing recovering pairs after stops hit or doubling down on fading positions hoping reversal without accepting initial loss as final—this vicious cycle stems from viewing losses personally rather than probabilistically leading to overtrading eroding accounts further in volatile markets demanding organised enduring emotional management without revenge impulses overriding discipline for sustainable participation without wipeouts from chained negatives regionally.
