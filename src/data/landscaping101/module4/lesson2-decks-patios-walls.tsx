### Installation Process

1. **Site Preparation**:
   * Assess soil (e.g., clay), drainage, and site conditions during analysis; ensure compliance with local building codes.
   * Mark the deck footprint and check for utilities (e.g., gas lines).
   * Example: For a 10x10-foot deck in the backyard, confirm stable clay soil and no underground utilities.

2. **Foundation**:
   * Install concrete footings or piers (8–12 inches deep) to support posts, spaced 6–8 feet apart.
   * Use post anchors to secure wooden posts to footings.
   * Example: Pour four concrete footings for a 10x10-foot deck, 8 inches deep.

3. **Framing**:
   * Build a frame with pressure-treated beams and joists, securing with galvanized hardware.
   * Ensure a slight slope (1–2%) for water runoff.
   * Example: Construct a frame with 2x8 joists, spaced 16 inches apart, sloped away from the house.

4. **Decking Installation**:
   * Lay deck boards (e.g., composite or cedar) perpendicular to joists, securing with screws or hidden fasteners.
   * Leave 1/8-inch gaps for expansion and drainage.
   * Example: Install composite decking boards with hidden fasteners for a clean look.

5. **Finishing**:
   * Add railings (required for decks over 30 inches high), stairs, or accessories (e.g., built-in benches).
   * Apply sealant or stain to wood decks for protection.
   * Example: Add a 36-inch-high cedar railing and seal the deck with a weather-resistant stain.

6. **Inspection**:
