# Understanding the Four-Stroke Engine Cycle 🔧

## Intake Stroke (Suck)

The intake stroke begins the four-stroke cycle, where the intake valve opens to allow a precisely calibrated air-fuel mixture into the cylinder.

**How It Works:**
* Piston moves downward, creating a vacuum
* Intake valve opens
* Air-fuel mixture drawn through intake manifold
* Throttle valve controls airflow
* Typical air-fuel ratio: 14.7:1 for petrol engines

**Importance:**

The intake stroke's efficiency directly impacts engine power and fuel economy, making it a focal point for diagnosing issues like vacuum leaks or throttle body malfunctions.

This is the engine's first step in converting fuel into motion, requiring precise coordination between the throttle, intake valves, and fuel delivery system.

**Common Issues:**
* Clogged air filters
* Faulty intake valves
* Vacuum leaks
* Throttle body malfunctions

These issues can disrupt the stroke, leading to poor performance or stalling. By mastering the intake stroke, mechanics can diagnose and resolve these issues, ensuring vehicles deliver optimal power and efficiency.

## Compression Stroke (Squash)

During the compression stroke, both intake and exhaust valves close, and the piston moves upward, compressing the air-fuel mixture into a smaller volume.

**Key Features:**
* Both valves closed
* Piston moves upward
* Mixture compressed to smaller volume
* Temperature and pressure increase
* Typical compression ratio: 8:1 to 12:1 in petrol engines

**Why It Matters:**

This compression increases the mixture's temperature and pressure, preparing it for ignition. Higher compression ratios enhance power output but risk knocking if not carefully managed.

The compression stroke is where the engine builds the potential energy needed for the power stroke, making it a critical phase for performance and efficiency.

**Potential Problems:**
* Worn piston rings
* Leaking valves
* Reduced compression leading to power loss or misfires

Mechanics mastering this stroke can diagnose such problems using tools like compression testers, ensuring engines operate at peak performance.

## Power Stroke (Bang)

The power stroke is the engine's energy-producing phase, where the spark plug ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture, creating an explosion that forces the piston downward.

**The Process:**
* Spark plug ignites compressed mixture
* Explosion forces piston downward
* Mechanical energy generated
* Energy transferred to crankshaft
* Powers the vehicle

**Critical Factors:**

Precise spark timing, controlled by the engine control unit (ECU), ensures efficient combustion and prevents issues like pre-ignition or detonation.

This is the only stroke that produces usable work, making it central to engine performance.

**Common Issues:**
* Faulty spark plugs
* Incorrect timing
* Misfires
* Reduced power

Mechanics must diagnose using tools like oscilloscopes or OBD-II scanners. By mastering this stroke, learners can fine-tune engines for maximum efficiency and performance.

## Exhaust Stroke (Blow)

In the exhaust stroke, the exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward to expel burnt gases from the cylinder, clearing the chamber for the next cycle.

**How It Works:**
* Exhaust valve opens
* Piston moves upward
* Burnt gases expelled from cylinder
* Chamber cleared for next cycle

**Key Components:**
* Exhaust manifold
* Catalytic converter
* Muffler

These components direct and treat exhaust gases to meet environmental standards.

**Importance:**

The exhaust stroke is essential for engine health and environmental compliance, as it removes waste gases that could otherwise cause carbon buildup or reduced performance.

**Diagnostic Focus:**
* Clogged catalytic converters
* Leaking exhaust valves
* Exhaust restrictions
* Backpressure issues

This stroke's efficiency impacts fuel economy and emissions, making it a focal point for mechanics working on modern vehicles subject to strict regulations like Euro 6 or EPA standards.

## Key Takeaways

* **Intake Stroke:** Draws air-fuel mixture into cylinder
* **Compression Stroke:** Compresses mixture for efficient combustion
* **Power Stroke:** Ignites mixture to generate mechanical energy
* **Exhaust Stroke:** Expels burnt gases to prepare for next cycle

Understanding these four strokes is fundamental to diagnosing and repairing petrol engines effectively.
