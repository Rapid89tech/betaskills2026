          'They grow faster than non-native plants',
          'They require daily watering',
          'They provide habitat and food for local wildlife',
          'They produce more flowers per season'
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: 'Native plants are adapted to local conditions and provide essential habitat and food for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife, supporting local ecosystems.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Which soil condition is typical of Zone 7\'s central North Carolina example site?',
        options: [
          'Sandy and dry',
          'Clay with slow drainage',
          'Rocky and alkaline',
          'Loamy and acidic'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'The example Zone 7 site in central North Carolina has clay soil with slow drainage, which is common in that region.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Which native tree is best suited as a shade-providing focal point in the example landscape?',
        options: [
          'Eastern Redbud',
          'Red Maple',
          'Dogwood',
          'Sweetgum'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Red Maple (Acer rubrum) is a deciduous tree that provides excellent shade, vibrant fall color, and is tolerant of clay soil, making it ideal as a focal point.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is one advantage of planting Virginia Sweetspire (Itea virginica)?',
        options: [
          'Requires heavy fertilization',
          'Grows best in dry, sandy soils only',
          'Attracts pollinators and has good fall color',
          'Loses leaves early in summer'
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: 'Virginia Sweetspire is pollinator-friendly, offers attractive fall color, and adapts well to both wet and dry soil conditions.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What design principle supports ecosystem resilience through multiple plant heights and layers?',
        options: [
          'Monoculture planting',
          'Layered planting',
          'Mass planting',
          'Controlled pruning'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Layered planting creates vertical layers (canopy, understory, groundcover) that mimic natural ecosystems and provide diverse habitats for wildlife.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Which of the following is not a recommended strategy for enhancing biodiversity?',
        options: [
          'Using a mix of native trees, shrubs, and perennials',
          'Installing wildlife features like ponds and birdhouses',
          'Applying broad-spectrum pesticides frequently',
          'Leaving seed heads for birds during fall'
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: 'Applying broad-spectrum pesticides frequently harms beneficial insects and pollinators, reducing biodiversity rather than enhancing it.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is one reason native plants are considered more sustainable?',
        options: [
          'They need more fertilizer',
          'They are genetically modified',
          'They are adapted to local climate and soil, needing less maintenance',
          'They only survive in controlled environments'
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: 'Native plants are adapted to local climate and soil conditions, requiring less water, fertilizer, and pesticides, making them more sustainable.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why should landscapers source plants from local native nurseries?',
        options: [
          'Local nurseries are cheaper',
          'To ensure plants are genetically suited to the local ecosystem',
          'To get plants in full bloom year-round',
          'To avoid pruning'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Sourcing from local native nurseries ensures plants are genetically suited to the local ecosystem, with appropriate adaptations for climate and soil.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What maintenance practice supports biodiversity during winter months?',
        options: [
          'Removing all leaf litter',
          'Leaving seed heads and leaf litter for insects and birds',
          'Applying herbicides monthly',
          'Frequent mowing and pruning'
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: 'Leaving seed heads and leaf litter provides food and habitat for insects and birds during winter, supporting biodiversity.'
