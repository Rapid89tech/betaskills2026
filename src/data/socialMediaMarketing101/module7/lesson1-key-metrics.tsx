# Key Metrics Guide: Reach, Impressions, Engagement, CTR, Conversions 📈

This guide outlines key metrics—reach, impressions, engagement, click-through rate (CTR), and conversions—for evaluating the performance of marketing campaigns across platforms like Instagram, X, LinkedIn, and Google Ads. Understanding and tracking these metrics ensures campaigns align with brand goals and drive measurable results.

## Core Principles of Key Metrics

* **Actionability**: Analyze metrics to inform strategic adjustments (e.g., shift budget to high-performing ads).
* **Consistency**: Monitor metrics regularly to track trends and performance over time.
