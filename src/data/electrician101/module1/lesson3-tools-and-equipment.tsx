## Essential Hand Tools

### Screwdrivers
- Used to secure or remove screws in electrical panels, outlets, and fixtures
- Includes flathead and Phillips screwdrivers in various sizes
- **Insulated screwdrivers** protect against electrical shock

### Pliers
- Essential for gripping, twisting, and cutting wires and cables
- **Needle-nose pliers**: Precision work, bending wire ends, tight spaces
- **Lineman's pliers**: Heavy-duty tasks, cutting thick cables, twisting wires

### Wire Strippers
- Remove insulation from electrical wires without damaging the conductor
- Adjustable for various wire gauges
- Some models include built-in cutters for trimming wires

## Testing and Diagnostic Equipment

### Voltage Testers and Multimeters
- **Voltage testers**: Detect presence of electrical current
- **Multimeters**: Measure voltage, current, and resistance
- **Non-contact voltage testers**: Check for voltage without direct contact
- Essential for safety and troubleshooting

### Thermal Imaging Cameras
- Detect hot spots or overheating components
- Identify potential faults before they cause failures
- Useful for preventive maintenance
- Troubleshoot complex systems

## Installation Tools

### Conduit Benders
- Shape metal or PVC conduit pipes to route wiring
- Available in manual or hydraulic models
- Bend conduits to specific angles without kinking
- Essential for code-compliant installations

### Power Drills and Saws
- Create holes for mounting electrical boxes
- Run conduit or secure fixtures
- **Reciprocating saws or hole saws**: Cut through walls, wood, or metal
- **Cordless models**: Flexibility for areas without power access

### Fish Tape and Pullers
- Pull wires through conduits or walls during installation
- **Fish tape**: Standard wire pulling
- **Cable pullers**: Large or heavy cables through long runs

### Crimping Tools
- Attach connectors or terminals to wires
- Ensure secure and reliable electrical connections
- Available in manual or hydraulic versions
- Different sizes for various wire gauges

---

## Cutting Tools

### Pipe and Cable Cutters
- Cleanly slice through cables, conduit, or wiring
- **Ratcheting cable cutters**: Handle thick cables with precision
- Prevent fraying or damaging conductors

---

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

### Essential Safety Gear
- **Insulated gloves**: Protection from electrical shock
- **Safety glasses**: Eye protection from debris and sparks
- **Hard hats**: Protection from falling objects
- **Flame-resistant clothing**: Protection against arc flashes
- **Arc-rated PPE**: Used when working on live circuits
- **Non-conductive footwear**: Rubber-soled boots reduce shock risk

---

## Organization and Storage

### Tool Belts and Pouches
- Organize and provide easy access to tools
- Useful while working on ladders or in confined spaces
- Durable and designed for daily construction site use
- Multiple pockets for different tool types

---
