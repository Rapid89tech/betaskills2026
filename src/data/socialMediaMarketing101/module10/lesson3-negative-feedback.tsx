* **Traffic Tracking**:
  * Use GA4's anomaly detection to spot sudden traffic drops or spikes.
  * Monitor conversions for crisis-related declines.

### Step 2: Assess and Categorize

* **Severity Levels**:
  * **Low**: Isolated complaints (e.g., single negative comment).
  * **Medium**: Multiple complaints or negative sentiment spike (e.g., product defect reports).
  * **High**: Viral crisis or widespread backlash (e.g., PR scandal, misinformation campaign).

  * Use Brandwatch to gauge sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative).
  * Identify primary complaint sources (e.g., X, Instagram, Reddit).
* **Impact Assessment**:
  * Use GA4 to measure traffic or conversion impacts.
  * Evaluate potential reputation damage via Hootsuite sentiment tracking.

### Step 3: Respond Strategically

* **Negative Feedback**:
  * Acknowledge promptly and empathetically (e.g., "We're sorry for your experience...").
  * Move sensitive discussions to private channels (e.g., DMs, email).
  * Offer solutions (e.g., refunds, replacements) to resolve issues.
* **Online Crises**:
  * Pause scheduled posts using Hootsuite or Later to avoid tone-deaf content.
  * Issue a public statement via social media, addressing the issue transparently.
  * Use Slack to coordinate team responses and align messaging.
* **Escalation Protocols**:
  * Assign roles (e.g., social media manager, PR team) for crisis response.
  * Escalate legal or severe issues to leadership or legal counsel.

### Step 4: Analyze and Mitigate

* **Analyze Impact**:
  * Use Brandwatch to track sentiment trends pre- and post-crisis.
  * Monitor GA4 for traffic or conversion declines during the crisis.
  * Evaluate engagement on response posts with Later.
* **Mitigate Damage**:
  * Address misinformation with factual, transparent communication.
  * Amplify positive UGC or testimonials to counter negative sentiment.
  * Update products/services based on feedback to prevent recurrence.
* **Report**:
  * Create dashboards in Brandwatch or GA4 to share with stakeholders.
  * Document lessons learned for future crisis planning.

### Step 5: Optimize and Prevent

* **Prevention**:
  * Train teams on crisis response protocols using Slack.
  * Conduct regular audits to identify potential risks (e.g., product quality issues).
