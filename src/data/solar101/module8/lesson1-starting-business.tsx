# Starting a Solar Installation Business 💼

Starting a solar installation business positions entrepreneurs in one of the fastest-growing sectors, capitalizing on surging demand amid rising utility costs and incentives like the extended ITC. With global solar installations projected to reach 655 GW in 2025—a 10% increase from 2024—the market offers substantial opportunities. In 2025, success hinges on navigating streamlined permitting, AI-driven design tools, and ethical supply chains, enabling startups to achieve 20-30% YoY growth through targeted niches like rooftop retrofits or hybrid ESS integrations.

## Key Steps for Launching

### Market Research and Niche Selection
Analyze local demand via SEIA reports, competition, and incentives; focus on underserved areas like commercial or off-grid installs.

### Business Planning and Legal Setup
Draft comprehensive plan covering finances, operations, and marketing; register as LLC, obtain EIN, and secure state-specific contractor licenses.

### Certifications and Training
Pursue NABCEP credentials; train staff on NEC 2023 and safety protocols to meet insurer and AHJ requirements.

### Funding and Financial Management
Bootstrap or seek SBA loans/ITC financing; budget R750,000-R3,000,000 startup costs for tools, vehicles, and inventory.

### Team Building and Partnerships
Hire certified installers (start with 2-3); partner with suppliers like CED Greentech; use CRMs for efficient onboarding.

### Operations and Marketing Setup
Invest in design software and lead gen tools; launch digital marketing via SEO and local networks.

### Launch and Scaling
Secure insurance (R15M+ liability), bid on pilots, and monitor KPIs like CAC and LTV.

## Best Practices

- Target high-growth areas like commercial ESS
- Validate plans with 6-month pilots
- Budget 10-15% for insurance/licenses
