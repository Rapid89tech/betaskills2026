# Overview of Flat Roof Systems 🏠

## Introduction

Flat roofs, with slopes of 1/4 inch per foot (2%) or less, are common in commercial, industrial, and modern residential buildings, offering space efficiency and a sleek aesthetic.

Flat roofs require careful design to ensure drainage and durability, making them a unique challenge compared to steep-slope roofs. Understanding their components and systems equips learners to design and maintain effective flat roofs, supported by course resources for practical mastery.

## Key Characteristics and Types

* **Characteristics**: Minimal slope, space for utilities/gardens, easier maintenance, cost-effective for large buildings.  
* **Types**:  
  * **Built-Up Roof (BUR)**:  https://youtu.be/mcruxSCF8C4
    Bitumen and felt layers, gravel top, durable for commercial use.  
  * **Modified Bitumen**:  https://youtu.be/Kq3E-PkOpgE
     Asphalt sheets with APP/SBS modifiers, heat/cold applied.  
  * **Single-Ply Membranes**:  https://youtu.be/5EB5B5kBY5s
     TPO, PVC, EPDM, flexible and modern.  
  * **Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF)**:  https://youtu.be/IqGVyCMZLWE
    Seamless foam with UV coating, energy-efficient.  
  * **Green Roof**: https://youtu.be/sQ3veFk1C24
     Vegetation over waterproof membrane, sustainable.  
  * **Metal Flat Roof**: https://youtu.be/Y2iTesCOzF0
     Sealed metal panels, low-maintenance.

* **Decking/Substrate**: Plywood, concrete, or metal base.  
* **Insulation**: Controls temperature, prevents condensation.  
* **Vapor Barrier**: Stops moisture from below.  
* **Membrane Layer**: Primary waterproofing (BUR, TPO, etc.).  
* **Protective Surfacing**: Gravel, coatings for UV/fire resistance.  
* **Flashing**: Seals edges, penetrations.  
* **Drains/Scuppers**: Prevents ponding.

## Advantages, Disadvantages, and Maintenance

* **Advantages**: Easy access, lower cost for large buildings, usable roof space, modern aesthetic.  
* **Disadvantages**: Drainage issues, shorter lifespan, higher maintenance, ponding risk.  
* **Maintenance**: Inspect twice yearly, check for blisters/cracks, clear drains, reapply coatings, monitor ponding.

## Discussion Questions

* What are the advantages of single-ply membranes over BUR?  
* Why is proper drainage crucial for flat roofs?  
* How do green roofs impact performance and sustainability?  
* What maintenance practices prolong flat roof life?  
* How does the choice of flat roof system affect insulation/energy efficiency?
