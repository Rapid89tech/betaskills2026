# Major Project Execution: Custom Oak Dining Table 🛠️

This lesson provides a comprehensive walkthrough of executing a major carpentry project using the custom oak dining table as a practical example, demonstrating the integration of all learned skills from design through delivery.

## Project Overview

**Specifications**:
- **Dimensions**: 2.4m (L) x 1m (W) x 0.75m (H)
- **Material**: Solid FSC-certified oak
- **Capacity**: Seating for 8 people
- **Finish**: Natural grain with water-based polyurethane coating
- **Budget**: R30,950
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks

## Detailed Execution Steps

### Week 1: Design and Material Preparation

**Day 1-3: Design Phase**:
1. Initial consultation with client
2. Measure dining space with laser measure (Bosch GLM 50 C)
3. Create 3D model in SketchUp
4. Present design options for legs and apron styles
5. Select mortise and tenon joinery for strength
6. Obtain client approval and 50% deposit (R15,475)

**Day 4-5: Planning and Sourcing**:
1. Create detailed cut list:
   - 4 tabletop boards: 2.4m x 0.25m x 25mm
   - 4 legs: 0.75m x 0.08m x 0.08m
   - 4 aprons: 1.2m x 0.1m x 0.025m
2. Source oak from Timbercity (0.07m³ + 10% waste = 0.077m³ at R214/m³)
3. Order polyurethane (2 liters), sandpaper, dowels/biscuits
4. Prepare workshop: set up dust collection, organize tools
5. Acclimate oak in workshop (48–72 hours to reach 6–12% MC)

### Week 2: Construction and Assembly

**Day 6-8: Cutting and Preparation**:
1. Inspect oak boards for defects (knots, warping)
2. Cross-cut tabletop boards to 2.4m length with miter saw
3. Rip-cut to 0.25m width with table saw
4. Plane all boards to uniform 25mm thickness
5. Cross-cut legs to 0.75m and aprons to 1.2m lengths
6. Rip-cut legs to 8x8cm and aprons to 10x2.5cm
7. Sand all components with 120 grit to remove mill marks

**Day 9-11: Joinery**:
1. Mark mortise locations on legs using marking gauge (2x5cm, centered)
2. Cut mortises with router and straight bit (1/4" depth increments)
3. Square mortise corners with chisel
4. Mark tenons on apron ends with combination square
5. Cut tenons with table saw and tenoning jig (2x5cm to fit mortises)
6. Test-fit all mortise and tenon joints
7. Adjust with chisel for tight fit (friction fit without glue)
8. Mark tabletop board positions for alignment
9. Cut biscuit slots with biscuit joiner every 12 inches along edges

**Day 12-13: Assembly**:
1. Dry-fit leg and apron assembly to verify squareness
2. Measure diagonals to confirm (should be equal)
3. Apply Titebond III glue to mortise and tenon joints
4. Assemble leg frame; clamp with parallel clamps (100–150 psi)
5. Check squareness with try square; adjust if needed
6. Allow 24-hour cure time
7. Glue tabletop boards edge-to-edge with biscuits
8. Clamp with bar clamps using cauls to keep surface flat
9. Allow 24-hour cure time

### Week 3: Finishing and Delivery

**Day 14-15: Surface Preparation**:
1. Remove table from clamps
2. Scrape excess glue with chisel; sand glue lines
3. Plane tabletop surface if necessary for flatness
4. Sand entire table progressively:
   - 120 grit: Remove scratches and flatten
   - 180 grit: Smooth surface
   - 220 grit: Pre-finish smoothing
   - 320 grit: Final smoothing for finish
5. Ease all edges with 220 grit to prevent splinters
6. Vacuum and wipe with tack cloth to remove all dust

**Day 16-17: Finishing**:
1. Set up finishing area with drop cloths and ventilation
2. Stir water-based polyurethane gently (avoid bubbles)
3. Apply first coat with high-quality foam brush, working along grain
4. Allow 4 hours drying time
5. Sand lightly with 400 grit to remove any raised grain
6. Clean with tack cloth
7. Apply second coat; allow 4 hours drying
8. Sand lightly with 400 grit
9. Clean with tack cloth
10. Apply third coat for final protection
11. Allow 7 days for full curing

**Day 18: Final Inspection**:
1. Inspect table for:
   - Joint tightness and alignment
   - Surface smoothness and finish quality
   - Stability and levelness
2. Polish finish with 0000 steel wool for satin sheen
3. Wipe clean with soft cloth
4. Apply felt pads to leg bottoms to protect floors
5. Photograph finished table from multiple angles
6. Create maintenance guide for client

**Day 19-20: Delivery and Installation**:
1. Wrap table in moving blankets; secure with ratchet straps
2. Load into van carefully (2-person lift)
3. Transport to client's home (R500–R2,000 within Johannesburg)
4. Unload and position in dining area
5. Level table using shims if necessary
6. Conduct walkthrough with client:
   - Demonstrate stability and joinery quality
   - Show grain patterns and finish
   - Explain maintenance: clean with damp cloth, avoid harsh chemicals, reapply polyurethane every 2–3 years
7. Present maintenance guide and warranty
8. Collect final payment (R15,475)
9. Request testimonial and permission to photograph in situ

## Key Learning Points

### Design Integration
- Ergonomic considerations ensure comfort
- Material selection balances cost, durability, and aesthetics
- 3D modeling facilitates client communication and approval

### Planning Efficiency
- Detailed cut lists minimize waste
- Realistic timelines account for drying and curing
- Comprehensive budgets include all cost categories

### Construction Quality
- Acclimation prevents wood movement post-construction
- Dry-fitting identifies issues before permanent assembly
- Progressive joinery ensures tight, strong connections

### Finishing Excellence
- Progressive sanding (120–320 grit) creates smooth surface
- Multiple thin coats better than single thick coat
- Proper curing time ensures durability

### Professionalism
- Regular client updates build trust
- Thorough walkthrough demonstrates quality
- Maintenance documentation ensures long-term satisfaction
