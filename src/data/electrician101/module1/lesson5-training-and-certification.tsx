## A. Education

### High School Diploma or GED (Required)
- Minimum educational requirement for most training programs
- Key subjects:
  - **Mathematics** (algebra, geometry) for electrical calculations
  - **Physics** for understanding electrical theory
  - **Technical drawing** for reading blueprints
- Shop or vocational programs provide early exposure

### Technical School or Community College Programs (Optional)
- Diploma or associate degree programs (6 months to 2 years)
- Covers:
  - Electrical theory
  - Wiring techniques

### Classroom Instruction
- Electrical theory
- Blueprint reading
- Circuit design
- Safety protocols
- Local/national electrical codes
- Specialized systems training (fire alarms, data networks, high-voltage equipment)
- **144–180 hours** of classroom instruction per year

### On-the-Job Training
- Work under licensed journeyman or master electricians
- **8,000–10,000 hours** of supervised work required
