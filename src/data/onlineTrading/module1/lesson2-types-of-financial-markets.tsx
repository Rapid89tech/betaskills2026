      <p>
        Financial markets can be categorized into several main types based on the instruments traded, the maturity of assets, or the way trading occurs. Each type serves specific needs in the economy, from short-term borrowing to long-term investment and risk management. Understanding these distinctions helps participants choose the right market for their goals, whether raising capital, investing savings, or hedging risks.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Types of Financial Markets</h2>

      <h3>Stock (equity) markets</h3>
      <p>
        These markets enable the buying and selling of ownership shares in publicly listed companies. When investors purchase shares, they acquire a portion of the company and potentially benefit from its growth through rising share prices or dividend payments. Stock markets are crucial for companies seeking to raise capital for expansion without incurring debt. In South Africa, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is the central platform where shares of major domestic and international companies are traded in rands, providing local investors access to diverse sectors such as mining, finance, and retail while contributing to the country's economic development.
      </p>

      <h3>Bond (debt) markets</h3>
      <p>
        Focused on trading debt securities, these markets allow governments, municipalities, and corporations to borrow funds by issuing bonds. Bondholders lend money in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of principal at maturity. This market is essential for financing long-term projects like infrastructure or public services. South African government bonds, traded in rands on platforms linked to the JSE, are a cornerstone for stable, fixed-income investments and play a significant role in funding national priorities.
      </p>

      <h3>Money markets</h3>
      <p>
        These are short-term debt markets where instruments with maturities of less than one year are traded, such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements (repos). They provide high liquidity for institutions needing to manage short-term cash needs or park surplus funds safely. In South Africa, the money market facilitates daily liquidity for banks and corporations, with instruments often denominated in rands and influenced by the South African Reserve Bank's monetary policy decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign exchange (forex) markets</h3>
      <p>
        The world's largest and most liquid market, where currencies are traded against one another around the clock. Participants include banks, corporations, governments, and speculators who exchange rands for other currencies to support international trade, travel, investment, or to protect against exchange rate fluctuations. The decentralized nature of forex means trades occur over-the-counter, with rand pairs like USD/ZAR being actively monitored by South African businesses engaged in imports and exports.
      </p>

      <h3>Commodity markets</h3>
      <p>
        These involve trading physical goods or raw materials such as gold, platinum, oil, agricultural products, and metals. Prices are driven by global supply and demand dynamics. South Africa has a strong presence here due to its rich mineral resources, with commodities like gold and platinum traded on exchanges or over-the-counter, often priced in rands for local participants, supporting industries from mining to agriculture.
      </p>

      <h3>Derivatives markets</h3>
      <p>
        Markets for contracts whose value is derived from underlying assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities. Common instruments include futures, options, forwards, and swaps, used mainly for hedging risks (e.g., locking in future prices) or speculation. In South Africa, derivatives are traded on the JSE's platforms in rands, helping farmers, miners, and exporters manage price volatility in commodities or currency exposure.
      </p>

      <h3>Capital markets</h3>
      <p>
        A broader category encompassing stock and bond markets, focused on longer-term financing (over one year). They channel savings into productive investments that drive economic growth. In contrast to money markets, capital markets in South Africa, primarily through the JSE, enable large-scale funding for corporate expansion and government initiatives using rand-denominated instruments.
      </p>

      <h2>Markets by Structure</h2>

      <h3>Primary markets</h3>
      <p>
        Where new securities are issued directly to investors, allowing entities to raise fresh capital (e.g., initial public offerings or new bond issuances).
      </p>

      <h3>Secondary markets</h3>
      <p>
        Where existing securities are traded among investors, providing liquidity and enabling price discovery without new capital flowing to the issuer.
      </p>

      <h3>Exchange-traded markets</h3>
      <p>
        Organized platforms like the JSE with standardized rules, transparent pricing, and centralized clearing.
      </p>

      <h3>Over-the-counter (OTC) markets</h3>
      <p>
        Decentralized, negotiated directly between parties, common in forex, certain bonds, and derivatives for more customized terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        These types interconnect, allowing participants to diversify strategies and contribute to efficient capital flow across the South African and global economy.
