# Electrical Project Estimating 💰

## Estimating Process Overview

### Steps
1. Review project scope and drawings
2. Perform material takeoff
3. Calculate labor hours
4. Determine equipment needs
5. Add overhead and profit
6. Prepare proposal

---

## Material Takeoff

### Counting Methods
- Count each item from drawings
- Use software tools (digitizers, CAD)
- Create organized material list
- Include waste factors (10-15%)
- Group by category

### Items to Count
- Wire (by length and type)
- Conduit and fittings
- Boxes and covers
- Devices (outlets, switches)
- Panels and breakers
- Light fixtures
- Special equipment

---

## Labor Estimation

### Factors Affecting Labor
- Complexity of installation
- Working conditions
- Height of work
- Accessibility
- Crew experience
- Project schedule

### Labor Units
- Hours per unit installed
- Industry standard tables (NECA, RS Means)
- Company historical data
- Adjust for project conditions

### Common Labor Rates (hours)
- Outlet installation: 0.5-0.75 hrs
- Switch installation: 0.3-0.5 hrs
- Light fixture: 0.75-1.5 hrs
- Panel installation: 4-8 hrs
- Conduit per 100 ft: 3-6 hrs

## Pricing

### Material Costs
- Supplier pricing
- Volume discounts
- Delivery charges
- Sales tax
- Contingency (5-10%)

### Labor Costs
- Hourly wage rates
- Burden (benefits, insurance)
- Typically multiply wage by 1.4-1.8
- Travel time
- Cleanup and disposal

### Equipment Costs
- Tools and equipment
- Vehicle costs
- Rental equipment
- Small tools allowance

### Overhead
- Office expenses
- Insurance
- Licenses and permits
- Marketing
- Typically 15-25% of costs

### Profit
- Market conditions
- Competition
- Project risk
- Client relationship
- Typically 10-20%

---

## Types of Pricing

### Time and Material (T&M)
- Bill actual hours and materials
- Plus markup percentage
- Good for uncertain scope
- Requires detailed tracking

### Fixed Price (Lump Sum)
- Total price for complete job
- Contractor assumes risk
- Clear for customer
- Requires accurate estimate

### Unit Pricing
- Price per device/fixture
- Per foot for wire/conduit
- Clear and simple
- Easy to adjust quantities

---

## Competitive Bidding

### Bid Preparation
- Read specifications carefully
- Attend pre-bid meetings
- Ask questions about unclear items
- Visit job site
- Note special conditions

### Bid Strategy
- Determine if project is good fit
- Assess competition
- Decide on profit margin
- Include all costs
- Submit on time

---

## Software Tools

- Estimating software (Accubid, ConEst)
- Spreadsheets for smaller projects
- Digital takeoff tools
- Mobile apps for field estimates
- Integration with accounting

---

## Common Estimating Mistakes

- Underestimating labor
- Missing items in takeoff
- Not including permits/inspections
- Forgetting travel time
- Insufficient contingency
- Not accounting for difficult conditions

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Accurate estimates essential for profitability
- Be thorough in material takeoff
- Account for all costs
- Include appropriate overhead and profit
- Use historical data to improve accuracy
- Software tools increase efficiency
- Always include contingency
