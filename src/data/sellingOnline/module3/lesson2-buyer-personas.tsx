# Creating Buyer Personas

A buyer persona is a simple profile of your ideal customer. It helps you write better product listings, run better ads, and choose the right products.

## What to include

- Demographics (age, location, income)
- Goals (what they want to achieve)
- Pain points (what frustrates them)
- Buying triggers (why they purchase today)
- Objections (what stops them)
- Where they hang out online

## Example persona template

1. Name: (e.g. "Busy Mom Thandi")
2. Goal: Save time while still buying quality
3. Pain: Doesn’t trust unknown online stores
4. Trigger: Sees real reviews/UGC and clear returns
5. Budget: Comfortable spending X rands for reliability

## How personas improve sales

- Better messaging: you speak their language
- Better products: you solve real problems
- Better targeting: less wasted ad spend

## Action step

Create 2 personas:

- Primary buyer (most profitable)
- Secondary buyer (growth opportunity)
