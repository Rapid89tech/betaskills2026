# Security and Surveillance Systems 🔒

## Security System Components

### Control Panel
- Brain of the security system
- Processes inputs from sensors
- Manages alarms and notifications
- Connects to monitoring services

### Sensors and Detectors
- **Door/window contacts**: Magnetic switches
- **Motion detectors**: PIR or dual-technology
- **Glass break detectors**: Sound or vibration
- **Smoke/CO detectors**: Integrated or standalone

### Keypads and Controllers
- User interface for system
- Arm/disarm functions
- Zone status display
- Emergency buttons

### Sirens and Alarms
- Indoor sirens (loud alert)
- Outdoor sirens (deter intruders)
- Strobe lights
- Silent alarms to monitoring

---

## Surveillance Systems (CCTV)

### Camera Types
- **Dome cameras**: Ceiling mount, wide angle
- **Bullet cameras**: Wall mount, directional
- **PTZ cameras**: Pan, tilt, zoom capability
- **IP cameras**: Network connected, high resolution

### Recording Systems
- **DVR**: Digital Video Recorder (analog cameras)
- **NVR**: Network Video Recorder (IP cameras)
- Cloud storage options
- Local and remote viewing

### Cabling
- Coaxial for analog cameras (RG59/RG6)
- Cat5e/Cat6 for IP cameras
- Power over Ethernet (PoE) for IP cameras
- Proper cable support and protection

---

## Access Control Systems

### Components
- Card readers (proximity, magnetic stripe, RFID)
- Keypads (PIN entry)
- Biometric readers (fingerprint, facial recognition)
- Electric strikes and magnetic locks
- Exit buttons and request-to-exit sensors

### Integration
- Connect to security system
- Log access events
- Time-based access control
- Integration with video surveillance

---

## Installation Best Practices

### Planning
- Assess property security needs
- Determine sensor and camera locations
- Plan wire routes
- Consider future expansion

### Wiring
- Use proper cable types
- Maintain separation from power lines
- Label all connections
- Home run or daisy-chain appropriately

### Programming
- Configure zones and devices
- Set up user codes
- Program schedules
- Test all functions

### Testing
- Test each sensor/camera
- Verify alarm functions
- Check battery backup
- Test monitoring connection

---

## Power Requirements

- Most systems use 12V or 24V DC
- Plug-in transformers for small systems
- Hardwired power supplies for larger systems
- Battery backup essential
- Calculate total power consumption

---

## Maintenance

- Test system monthly
- Replace batteries annually
- Clean cameras and sensors
- Update firmware
- Inspect connections

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Security systems require careful planning
- Proper installation ensures reliability
- Follow manufacturer specifications
- Integration adds functionality
- Regular testing and maintenance essential
- Consider future expansion needs
