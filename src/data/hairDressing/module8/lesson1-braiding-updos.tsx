# Braiding and Updos

Braiding and updo techniques are essential for any hairstylist, offering both everyday practicality and the ability to create show-stopping looks for special occasions. Mastery of these skills allows stylists to craft everything from simple, secure braids for daily wear to intricate, elegant updos for weddings, proms, and red-carpet events. Understanding the structure, tension, and finishing of these styles is key to ensuring they are both beautiful and long-lasting.

## French, Dutch, and Fishtail Braids

Braiding is a versatile art form in hairstyling, with each braid type offering a unique texture and visual effect. The French braid is a classic style that starts at the crown of the head and incorporates additional hair into each section as you move down the scalp. This technique creates a braid that lies flat against the head, making it ideal for both casual and formal looks. To create a French braid, the stylist begins with a small section at the crown, divides it into three equal parts, and alternately crosses the right and left sections over the middle, adding small pieces of hair each time. The result is a neat, secure braid that keeps hair in place all day, making it perfect for school, work, or active lifestyles.

### The Dutch Braid

Sometimes called an inside-out or inverted braid, is similar in structure to the French braid but with a key difference: the sections are crossed under the middle strand rather than over. This technique causes the braid to sit on top of the hair, creating a more pronounced, three-dimensional effect. Dutch braids are popular for edgier looks, double braids, or as a base for updos and festival styles. For added volume, stylists often "pancake" the braid by gently pulling at the outer edges, making the braid appear fuller and more textured.

### The Fishtail Braid

Offers a more intricate, woven appearance and is created using only two sections of hair. Small strands are taken from the outside of one section and crossed over to the other, repeating this process until the braid is complete. Fishtail braids are especially popular for bohemian, romantic, or bridal looks. They work best on hair that has a bit of texture or grip, so stylists often use a light mist of hairspray or texturizing spray before braiding. The finished braid can be left tight for a sleek effect or gently pulled apart for a softer, more relaxed style.

Braiding is not just about technique but also about adapting to the client's hair type and the occasion. For example, a French braid can be incorporated into a half-up style for a casual day look, while a Dutch braid can serve as the foundation for a dramatic updo. Fishtail braids are often chosen for bridesmaids or outdoor events, as they hold well and look beautiful even as they loosen throughout the day.

## Bridal and Event Updos

Updos are the hallmark of formal hairstyling, offering elegance, sophistication, and the ability to showcase the client's features and accessories. The classic low bun, or chignon, is a timeless choice for brides and formal events. This style involves gathering the hair at the nape of the neck, twisting it into a bun, and securing it with bobby pins. The chignon can be sleek and smooth for a polished look or textured and loose for a more romantic, modern feel. Accessories such as jeweled pins, combs, or fresh flowers can be added to elevate the style.

The messy chignon is a popular variation that embraces softness and movement. To create this look, the stylist loosely twists sections of hair and pins them at the nape, allowing a few strands to fall naturally around the face. This style is ideal for outdoor weddings or events where a relaxed, effortless vibe is desired. It can be enhanced with delicate accessories or left simple for understated elegance.

Braided updos combine the structure of braids with the sophistication of an updo. For example, a French or Dutch braid can be woven along the crown or sides of the head, with the remaining hair gathered into a bun or twisted updo. This technique adds texture and visual interest, making it a favorite for proms, galas, and themed events. Braided crowns, where the braid wraps around the head like a halo, are especially popular for bohemian or vintage-inspired weddings.

Vintage rolls and waves, such as victory rolls or pin curls, are another category of updos that require precise sectioning and pinning. These styles evoke the glamour of old Hollywood and are often chosen for themed parties or retro bridal looks. High buns, often paired with tiaras or veils, create a dramatic, regal effect and are perfect for brides seeking a statement hairstyle.

Preparation is crucial for successful updos. Hair should be prepped with volumizing mousse or texturizing spray to provide grip and hold. Sectioning the hair before styling ensures a clean, organized result. Practicing the full style before the event allows the stylist to perfect timing, product use, and accessory placement, ensuring everything goes smoothly on the big day.

## Securing Styles with Pins and Accessories

The longevity and security of braids and updos depend on the correct use of pins and accessories. Bobby pins are the most versatile tool for securing hair. For maximum hold, they should be inserted open-side-down and in a crisscross pattern, which locks the hair in place. Hiding pins under layers of hair creates a seamless, professional finish, and using pins that match the hair color ensures they remain invisible.

U-pins, or hairpins, are ideal for securing buns and updos without flattening the style. They are inserted by weaving them into the hair, which holds volume and shape while keeping the style comfortable. Spin pins are a modern alternative, designed to twist into buns and hold large sections of hair with fewer pins.

Clear elastics are essential for anchoring braids or securing the ends of styles invisibly. They are especially useful for intricate braids or when a natural, unbroken look is desired.

Accessories play a significant role in elevating hairstyles for special occasions. Hair combs and clips can add elegance and sparkle to bridal or formal styles. Floral pins and decorative pieces enhance romantic and bohemian looks, while headbands and tiaras are perfect for weddings and proms. Hair vines, which are flexible and adorned with crystals or pearls, can be woven through braids or wrapped around buns for a whimsical effect. Pearl pins or jeweled accents can be strategically placed to catch the light and add a touch of luxury.

Before securing an updo with accessories, it's important to ensure the style is balanced and symmetrical. Finishing with a strong-hold hairspray prevents flyaways and keeps the style intact throughout the event. Lightweight serums can be used to add shine and smoothness, especially for sleek or polished updos.

Proper pinning and accessorizing are not just about aesthetics—they are essential for comfort and durability. A well-secured style will withstand hours of dancing, movement, and even weather changes, ensuring the client looks and feels their best from start to finish.
