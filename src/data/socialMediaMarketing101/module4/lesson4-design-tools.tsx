This guide provides an overview of three popular graphic design tools—Canva, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator—focusing on their features, use cases, and best practices for creating professional, brand-aligned visuals. Each tool serves unique purposes, from beginner-friendly design to advanced vector and raster editing, ensuring versatility for various branding needs.

## Core Principles of Graphic Design Tools

Effective use of graphic design tools enhances visual branding, streamlines workflows, and ensures consistency across digital and print media. These principles apply to all tools discussed.
