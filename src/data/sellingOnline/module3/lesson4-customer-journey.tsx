# Customer Journey Mapping

Customer journey mapping is the process of visually outlining the complete path your buyers take from first discovering your brand to becoming loyal advocates, capturing their thoughts, emotions, and interactions at every step. Mapping this journey reveals where customers feel excited, frustrated, or hesitant, helping you smooth obstacles and amplify delights.

It shifts focus from isolated sales to holistic experiences, allowing you to align content, support, and offers with real behaviours—like the spark of inspiration when scrolling for braai ideas or the reassurance needed before committing to a handmade piece—creating seamless paths that nurture trust, encourage purchases, and inspire shares within local communities that value personal, thoughtful connections.

## Define the Main Stages of the Journey

Break the path into clear phases—awareness (when someone first encounters your brand, perhaps through a reel showing spices transforming a backyard braai), consideration (researching options, comparing your cultural crafts to alternatives), purchase (deciding to buy accessories that fit seaside routines), retention (post-buy experiences like follow-up tips for using blends in new recipes), and advocacy (sharing their positive promenade styling photos with friends).

Naming these stages provides a framework; for a family buyer discovering your spices during evening scrolls, mapping shows how initial curiosity builds to confident orders, highlighting moments to intervene—like quick replies easing doubts—with targeted content that guides them gently forward, turning passive interest into completed journeys that feel supported at every turn.

### The Five Key Stages:

**1. Awareness**
- First exposure to your brand
- Discovery through social media, search, or referrals
- Initial impression formation
- Problem recognition

**2. Consideration**
- Active research and comparison
- Evaluating options
- Reading reviews and testimonials
- Seeking more information

**3. Purchase**
- Decision-making moment
- Checkout process

**4. Retention**

**5. Advocacy**

## Identify Key Touchpoints

List every possible contact—social posts sparking awareness of handmade designs, website browsing for detailed spice descriptions, messages asking about accessory durability for coastal wear, checkout processes, delivery updates, or thank-you notes after purchase. Include both digital and any offline moments, like local pickup options for Gauteng buyers.

This touchpoint inventory reveals the full ecosystem; noticing that many discover your promenade accessories via stories but drop off at sizing questions signals a need for clearer guides or live Q&A sessions, allowing you to strengthen weak links and create consistent, reassuring experiences that keep customers moving smoothly toward buying and beyond, building familiarity across their preferred channels.

## Capture Emotions and Pain Points at Each Stage

For every phase, note how customers likely feel—excited curiosity when seeing authentic braai demos, hesitation over trust during consideration of handmade authenticity, relief at seamless checkout for coastal items, or delight from personalised follow-ups enhancing repeat use. Pair these with drivers like wanting to recreate family traditions through perfect flavours or frustrations such as unclear shipping details delaying promenade-ready purchases.

This emotional layering adds depth; understanding the joy of unboxing spices that evoke shared memories or the annoyance of mismatched accessory fits lets you infuse empathy into interactions—like reassuring messages addressing common worries—transforming potential drop-offs into positive momentum that motivates progression and fosters the warm feelings that encourage long-term loyalty.

## Gather Data from Multiple Sources

Pull information from analytics showing where traffic enters (like social reels driving spice awareness), customer messages revealing consideration questions about craft origins, order notes indicating purchase drivers such as bundle convenience for gatherings, and post-buy feedback highlighting retention joys or issues with seaside durability. Combine with surveys asking about promenade routine challenges or direct chats exploring braai prep pains.

This multi-source approach grounds the map in reality; patterns like frequent sizing inquiries for accessories or flavour customisation requests for blends provide concrete evidence, ensuring your visualisation reflects actual behaviours rather than assumptions and uncovers hidden opportunities to delight customers at overlooked moments.

### Data Sources:

**Quantitative Data:**
- Website analytics (traffic sources, bounce rates, conversion rates)
- Sales data (purchase patterns, cart abandonment)
- Email metrics (open rates, click-through rates)
- Social media insights (engagement, reach, demographics)
- Customer support tickets (common issues, response times)

**Qualitative Data:**
- Customer interviews
- Survey responses
- Review content analysis
- Social media comments
- Support conversation themes
- User testing observations
- Focus group feedback

## Create a Visual Map

Sketch or use simple tools to diagram the stages horizontally, with touchpoints, emotions, and actions layered below—perhaps icons for happy moments like discovering your cultural crafts or warning signs for pain points like delayed responses during accessory orders. Include quotes from real feedback, such as "Finally found spices that taste like home" for awareness wins or "Worried about fit for daily walks" signalling consideration hurdles.

This visual format makes complexities digestible; sharing it internally or with collaborators clarifies priorities, like enhancing live demos to address braai doubts early, while highlighting strengths such as post-purchase tips that spark advocacy, turning the abstract journey into a shared blueprint for coordinated improvements across your online presence.

## Pinpoint Opportunities and Remove Friction

Scan the map for gaps or bottlenecks—long waits between discovering handmade designs and finding purchase details, or missing guidance on blending spices for different braai styles—that cause drop-offs, then brainstorm fixes like streamlined links in stories or bundled suggestions for coastal accessory outfits. Celebrate high points, such as emotional peaks when customers share their promenade photos using your items, and amplify them with follow-up content.

This opportunity spotting drives impact; addressing a common pain like unclear shipping for Gauteng orders with proactive updates reduces abandonment, while boosting joys like personalised thank-yous encourages shares, smoothing the path to create journeys that feel effortless and rewarding, motivating more completions and enthusiastic recommendations.

Update the map regularly with fresh insights from new interactions or seasonal patterns, such as increased demand for lighter blends during warmer gatherings.

This iterative cycle keeps the journey current; adapting to evolving emotions, like growing appreciation for sustainable handmade practices, ensures continuous relevance, refining experiences that not only convert interest into sales but nurture lasting relationships where customers return and advocate because every step feels thoughtfully designed for their real lives.
