## Role of Coolant

https://youtu.be/HPVckPH6o-w?si=XgHWKXX3lV74hfJW

          Coolant, a 50/50 mix of ethylene/propylene glycol and water, regulates engine temperature by 
          absorbing and transferring heat, prevents freezing in cold climates, and protects against corrosion 
          in the radiator, water pump, and engine block. It ensures the engine operates within safe 
          temperature ranges (80–100°C), avoiding damage like warped heads or blown gaskets.

          Learners will explore coolant properties in virtual simulations, understanding its role in heat 
          dissipation and corrosion prevention. Low or degraded coolant can cause overheating, leading to 
          repairs costing thousands of rands.

          Mechanics mastering coolant maintenance ensure reliable cooling, extending engine life. The AI 
          voice tutor can explain coolant types or diagnose overheating causes, offering practical insights 
          for workshops.

## Checking Coolant Levels

          Checking coolant when the engine is cold involves inspecting the reservoir's "MIN" and "MAX" marks 
          or the radiator's level (near the neck). Topping up with a 50/50 coolant-water mix maintains 
          system pressure and prevents overheating.

          Low levels may indicate leaks, while overfilling can cause pressure buildup, damaging hoses. 
          Learners will practice checks in virtual scenarios, identifying issues like air bubbles or low 
          levels.

          Regular checks, ideally monthly, ensure cooling efficiency, especially in hot South African 
          climates. Mechanics mastering this task prevent costly overheating damage, ensuring vehicle 
          reliability. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through safe checking procedures or spotting 
          leaks, ensuring accurate maintenance.

## Testing Coolant Condition

          Coolant condition is assessed for rust, cloudiness, or particles, indicating corrosion or 
          contamination (e.g., milky coolant suggests a head gasket leak). A coolant tester measures 
          freeze/boil protection (e.g., -37°C to 129°C), ensuring system reliability.

          Rusty coolant can clog radiators, reducing cooling efficiency, while contaminated coolant may 
          corrode components. Learners will use virtual testers to evaluate coolant, identifying issues 
          like scale buildup.

          This skill helps mechanics diagnose cooling system failures early, preventing major repairs. The 
          AI voice tutor can explain tester usage or contamination signs, enhancing diagnostic precision 
          for real-world applications.

## Flushing and Replacing Coolant

          Coolant flushes, needed every 50,000–100,000 kilometres, involve draining old coolant, flushing 
          the system with water or a cleaning solution, and refilling with fresh coolant. Running the engine 
          with the radiator cap off removes air bubbles, ensuring proper circulation.

          Improper flushes can leave air pockets, causing overheating, or old coolant can corrode components. 
          Learners will simulate flushes, practicing techniques to avoid blockages.

          This task maintains cooling efficiency, critical for engine longevity. Mechanics mastering flushes 
          ensure reliable systems, preventing costly failures. The AI voice tutor can guide learners through 
          flush procedures or air bubble removal, ensuring precision.

## Safety in Coolant Handling

          Coolant handling requires PPE like gloves and goggles, as it's toxic and can cause skin irritation 
          or burns if hot. Never open a hot radiator cap to avoid scalding from pressurized steam.

          Used coolant must be disposed of at recycling centres per South African regulations (e.g., 
          Hazardous Waste Management guidelines), and spills cleaned immediately to prevent slips or 
          environmental harm.

          Learners will practice safe handling in virtual scenarios, using PPE and proper disposal methods. 
          Mishandling can lead to injuries or fines, making safety critical. Mechanics mastering these 
          practices ensure safe, compliant workshops. The AI voice tutor can explain safe handling protocols 
          or local disposal rules, ensuring adherence to standards.

## Key Takeaways

          Routine maintenance tasks like oil changes, air filter replacement, spark plug servicing, and 
          coolant checks ensure engine efficiency, longevity, and performance. Neglecting these tasks leads 
          to wear, reduced fuel economy, and costly repairs, emphasizing their importance.
