# Understanding Hair Structure and Types

Hairdressing is both an art and a science. To become a skilled hair professional, it is essential to understand the structure of hair, different hair types, and key characteristics like porosity and elasticity.

## 🧬 Hair Structure: Layers & Roles

Hair is composed of three main layers that determine its strength, texture, and overall health. These layers work together to protect the hair, provide structural integrity, and influence how it responds to styling and treatments.

### Cuticle: The Protective Outer Layer

The cuticle is the outermost layer of the hair shaft, acting as a barrier against environmental damage.

The cuticle serves as the hair's first line of defense, consisting of overlapping, scale-like cells made primarily of keratin that shield the inner structures from heat, chemicals, UV rays, and mechanical stress like brushing or styling. When healthy, it lies flat, reflecting light to give hair a shiny, smooth appearance, but damage from over-processing, such as frequent coloring or heat tools, can cause the scales to lift, leading to dullness, frizz, and increased vulnerability to breakage. Understanding the cuticle's role is crucial for hairdressers, as it directly impacts how products penetrate the hair— for instance, in low-porosity hair, a closed cuticle resists absorption, requiring specific techniques like steam treatments to open it temporarily. Proper care, including using pH-balanced shampoos and conditioners, helps maintain its integrity, preventing issues like split ends and ensuring long-term hair health.

### Cortex: The Strength and Color Core

The cortex is the thick middle layer that provides the hair's primary strength, elasticity, and pigmentation.

Comprising the bulk of the hair strand, the cortex is a fibrous matrix of keratin proteins intertwined with melanin pigments that determine natural hair color, ranging from eumelanin for dark shades to pheomelanin for reds and blondes. This layer's coiled protein chains, connected by hydrogen, salt, and disulfide bonds, grant hair its remarkable elasticity, allowing it to stretch up to 30% when wet without breaking, which is essential for styling techniques like curling or straightening. Chemical processes such as perming, relaxing, or dyeing target the cortex by breaking and reforming these bonds, but overuse can weaken it, leading to brittleness or color fading. Hairdressers must evaluate cortex health through tests like the wet stretch assessment to decide on safe treatments; for example, protein-rich reconstructors can rebuild damaged cortices in over-processed hair.

### Medulla: The Innermost Soft Core

The medulla is the soft, central layer found in some hair types, contributing to overall hair thickness.

Often absent in fine or blonde hair, the medulla consists of loosely packed cells and air spaces that provide minimal structural support but can influence hair's insulating properties and texture in thicker strands, such as those in coarse or graying hair. Its presence is more pronounced in animal fur for thermal regulation, but in humans, it varies genetically and may thin with age or hormonal changes. While not directly involved in styling, understanding the medulla helps hairdressers recognize why certain hairs feel "hollow" or more buoyant, affecting techniques like layering cuts or volumizing.

## Hair Types: Shape & Texture

https://youtu.be/2g5g5X0h4eQ

Hair types range from Straight → Wavy → Curly → Coily and are mainly determined by the shape of the hair follicle, influencing care and styling needs.

### Straight Hair (Type 1)

https://youtu.be/4z9j3jdyOGo

Straight hair is naturally smooth and lies flat due to round follicles, often appearing shiny but prone to oiliness.

Characterized by its sleek, linear form, straight hair emerges from perfectly round follicles that produce symmetrical strands with a closed cuticle, reflecting light for a glossy finish but allowing sebum to travel easily from scalp to ends, which can result in greasiness if not managed with clarifying shampoos. This type resists curling without heat or products, making it ideal for polished looks like bobs or ponytails, but it may lack volume, benefiting from texturizing sprays or root-lifting techniques.

### Wavy Hair (Type 2)

Wavy hair forms loose S-shaped patterns from oval follicles, offering a balance between straight and curly textures.

With its gentle undulations, wavy hair provides natural body and movement, making it adaptable for beachy waves or sleek styles, but it's susceptible to frizz in humid conditions due to the slightly lifted cuticle that disrupts smoothness. Subtypes range from fine, loose waves (2A) to thicker, more defined ones (2C), requiring moisture-balancing products like leave-in conditioners to enhance definition without weighing down.

### Curly Hair (Type 3)

Curly hair features defined loops or spirals from slanted follicles, often dry and requiring hydration-focused care.

Ranging from loose ringlets (3A) to tight corkscrews (3C), curly hair's elliptical follicle shape creates bouncy, voluminous textures that add personality but struggle with moisture retention as natural oils have difficulty traveling down the twisted shafts, leading to dryness and potential breakage. Stylists emphasize the Curly Girl Method, involving co-washing, scrunching, and avoiding sulfates to maintain curl integrity and reduce shrinkage.

### Coily Hair (Type 4)

Coily hair has tight zig-zag or coiled patterns from flattened follicles, known for density but fragility.

This type, often seen in African descent with subtypes from soft coils (4A) to dense kinks (4C), offers incredible versatility for protective styles like braids or twists but is inherently dry due to the follicle's shape impeding oil distribution, necessitating deep conditioning and sealing with butters or oils. Its high density provides volume but requires gentle detangling with wide-tooth combs to prevent breakage, and hairdressers focus on moisture-locking routines to combat shrinkage, which can reduce apparent length by up to 75%.

## 💧 Hair Porosity & Elasticity

These characteristics determine how hair interacts with moisture and withstands styling, guiding product and treatment choices.

### Hair Porosity: Moisture Absorption Levels

Porosity measures the hair's ability to absorb and retain water and products, categorized as low, medium, or high.

Influenced by genetics, damage, or treatments, porosity affects how effectively hair responds to hydration—low porosity features tightly bound cuticles that repel moisture, ideal for retention but challenging for product penetration, often requiring heat or alkaline openers like baking soda rinses. Medium porosity strikes a balance, absorbing evenly for healthy, manageable hair, while high porosity, with raised cuticles from bleaching or heat, soaks up moisture quickly but loses it fast, leading to frizz and necessitating sealing oils like argan or jojoba.

### Hair Elasticity: Stretch and Recovery

Elasticity indicates hair's flexibility and strength, influenced by protein bonds in the cortex.

High elasticity allows hair to stretch significantly and snap back, signifying robust health from strong disulfide and hydrogen bonds, while low elasticity results in brittle, snapping strands due to damage from over-processing or poor nutrition, repairable with protein treatments like keratin infusions. Medium elasticity offers moderate resilience, suitable for everyday styling.

## 🔄 Recap: Structure → Type → Porosity → Elasticity

Each hair strand is a layered structure whose shape determines your hair type:
- The cuticle regulates moisture flow (porosity)
- The cortex gives strength, color, curl pattern, and elasticity
- The medulla, when present, is just a soft core in thicker strands

## Conclusion

Understanding hair structure, types, porosity, and elasticity is fundamental in hairdressing. By identifying these characteristics, hair professionals can choose the right products, techniques, and treatments to enhance hair health and styling outcomes. Mastery of these concepts lays the foundation for becoming a skilled hairdresser.
