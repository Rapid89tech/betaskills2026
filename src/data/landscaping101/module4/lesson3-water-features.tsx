   * Cons: Limited size, less natural.
   * Best For: Small patios, courtyards.

2. **Wall Fountains**: Mounted on walls, water flows into a basin or trough.
   * Pros: Space-saving, elegant, modern aesthetic.
   * Cons: Requires a wall, limited water volume.
   * Best For: Urban or vertical spaces.

3. **In-Ground Fountains**: Built into the ground with jets or bubblers, often integrated with pools or patios.
   * Pros: Dramatic, customizable, high impact.
   * Cons: Complex installation, high cost.
   * Best For: Large or commercial landscapes.

4. **Bubbler Fountains**: Small, low-profile features with gentle water flow, often in rocks or basins.
   * Pros: Subtle, eco-friendly, blends with nature.
