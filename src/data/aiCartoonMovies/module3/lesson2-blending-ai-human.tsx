      <h2>Techniques for Blending AI with Human Touch-Up</h2>

      <h3>1. AI as a Starting Point</h3>
      <p>
        Use AI tools like MidJourney or Stable Diffusion to generate initial character designs, environments, or storyboard panels. Import AI outputs into Photoshop for detailed adjustments (e.g., refining textures, adding shadows) or Illustrator for vectorization (e.g., clean linework, scalable assets).
      </p>

      <h3>2. Sketch-to-AI Enhancement</h3>
      <p>
        Start with a hand-drawn sketch, then use tools like Leonardo AI or DALL·E to enhance it with AI-generated details, such as colors, textures, or backgrounds. Refine the enhanced image in Photoshop (e.g., adjusting lighting) or Illustrator (e.g., creating vector outlines).
      </p>

      <h3>3. Style Transfer and Customization</h3>
      <p>Apply AI-generated styles to sketches or designs in Photoshop/Illustrator. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Stable Diffusion to apply a 2D cartoon style to a sketch, then refine in Illustrator for clean lines</li>
        <li>Enhance an AI-generated character in Photoshop with custom textures or effects to match the animation's aesthetic</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Iterative Refinement</h3>
      <p>
        Generate multiple AI variations of a character or scene, then select the best option for touch-up in Photoshop/Illustrator. Iterate by combining AI outputs with manual edits, such as adjusting facial expressions in Photoshop or simplifying shapes in Illustrator for animation.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Integration with Animation Workflow</h3>
      <p>
        Pair AI-generated visuals with Photoshop/Illustrator to create animation-ready assets, such as character turnarounds or layered backgrounds. Use Illustrator's vector tools to ensure scalability for 2D animation or Photoshop's layering for 3D texture mapping.
      </p>
