<h2>3. Learning Activities</h2>

<h3>A. Bible Study & Group Discussion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Read key scriptures in small groups. Ask:
    <ul>
      <li>What do these verses teach us about how Christ lived?</li>
      <li>What character traits does Christ model?</li>
      <li>How can we reflect those traits in our homes, schools, and communities?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Encourage deep thinking and peer learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>B. "Christ in Me" Reflection Journal</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Students write a short personal reflection:
    <ul>
      <li>"How am I currently reflecting Christ?"</li>
      <li>"Which area (love, humility, forgiveness, etc.) do I struggle with most?"</li>
      <li>"How can I intentionally reflect Christ this week?"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Promote self-awareness and personal application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>C. Role-Play Scenarios</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: In pairs or groups, students act out everyday situations (e.g., handling conflict, helping someone in need) and show two responses: one that reflects Christ and one that doesn't.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Build moral reasoning and empathy through active learning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>D. "Christ-Like Character" Word Art</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Students create a visual poster or digital design with words or phrases that describe Christ's character (e.g., forgiving, servant-hearted, loving, truthful). They can include scripture references or personal commitments.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Reinforce vocabulary and values through creativity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>E. Weekly Challenge Commitment</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong>: Each student writes one action they will take this week to reflect Christ in a specific relationship or situation (e.g., "I will forgive my sibling," or "I will serve a classmate.")</li>
  <li><strong>Follow-Up</strong>: Briefly share in next week's class how it went.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Move from learning to life application.</li>
</ul>
