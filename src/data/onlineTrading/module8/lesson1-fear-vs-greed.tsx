          <p className="mb-4">
            Fear and greed represent the two dominant emotional forces driving trader behaviour in financial markets like forex pairs fluctuating on news or stocks reacting to earnings, where fear prompts panic selling during downturns locking losses prematurely or avoiding entries missing opportunities blending caution with paralysis preventing action, versus greed encouraging oversized positions chasing wins or holding too long hoping more gains without regard for reversals blending ambition with recklessness eroding capital through impulsive decisions without balanced enduring discipline. This psychological duality distorts rational analysis with fear amplifying perceived risks causing hesitation in valid setups or early exits cutting winners short, while greed inflates confidence ignoring warning signs like overbought indicators powering overexposure without risk limits—this constant tug-of-war demands self-awareness recognising triggers like heart racing on drawdowns prompting stops or euphoria after streaks signalling pause, delivering resilient trading that counters emotions through rules preventing fear-driven freezes or greed-fueled blowups without unchecked feelings overriding strategy in volatile conditions blending recognition with control for sustainable enduring performance without emotional cycles compounding mistakes regionally.
