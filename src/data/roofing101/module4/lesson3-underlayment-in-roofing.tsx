# Underlayment in Roofing 🧾

## Definition of Underlayment


Underlayment is a protective layer over decking, beneath roofing materials, acting as a secondary water barrier.

Underlayment is critical for waterproofing and protecting roof structures, especially during installation or material failure. Understanding its types and installation ensures learners can enhance roof durability and performance, supported by course resources for practical application.

* **Functions**: Waterproofing, moisture control, protection during installation, fire resistance, smooth surface.
* **Types**:
  * **Asphalt-Saturated Felt**: Inexpensive, traditional, used for shingles.
  * **Synthetic**: Lightweight, durable, UV-resistant, modern choice.
  * **Rubberized Asphalt**: Self-adhering, ideal for valleys/eaves.
  * **Peel-and-Stick**: Superior leak protection, high-risk areas.

## Installation and Considerations

* **Preparation**: Clean, dry, smooth deck.
* **Overlapping**: 2–4" horizontal, 6" vertical.
* **Fastening**: Roofing nails/cap staples; peel-and-stick requires no fasteners.
* **Special Areas**: Self-adhering membranes for valleys/eaves.
* **Weather**: Synthetic allows 90–180 days exposure; felt limited to 7–14 days.

Proper underlayment installation ensures waterproofing and durability, with specific types suited to roofing systems and climates. Course tools help learners master installation techniques, ensuring code compliance and long-term performance.

## Discussion Questions

* Why is underlayment critical despite waterproof roofing materials?
* Compare felt vs. synthetic underlayments.
* What underlayment suits tile roofs in cold climates?
* How does underlayment enhance fire resistance/energy efficiency?
* Why is overlapping underlayment sheets essential?
