**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/qfm0qVHK\_Ps](https://youtu.be/qfm0qVHK_Ps)   
A signal is a function that conveys information about a phenomenon. Signals can be electrical, acoustic, optical, or mechanical, used to transmit data or sound. In audio and communications, signals represent sound waves or data streams.

### **2\. What is an Analog Signal?**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/PhHc6sSIF8c](https://youtu.be/PhHc6sSIF8c)   
**Definition**: An analog signal is a continuous signal that varies smoothly over time and can take any value within a range.  
**Characteristics**:

* Continuous in both time and amplitude.  
* Represents information as fluctuations in voltage, current, or another physical quantity.  
* Closely mimics the original sound wave or physical phenomenon.  
  **Examples**:  
* Human voice captured by a microphone produces analog electrical signals.  
* Vinyl records, cassette tapes store analog audio.  
* Analog radios and televisions use analog signals.  
  **Waveform**: Smooth, continuous waveform that changes fluidly.

### **3\. What is a Digital Signal?**

**YOUTUBE LINK** [https://youtu.be/TaoQfzIvdPo](https://youtu.be/TaoQfzIvdPo)   
**Definition**: A digital signal represents information using discrete (binary) values, typically 0s and 1s.  
**Characteristics**:

* Discrete in both time and amplitude.  
* Converts continuous analog signals into a series of samples at specific intervals (sampling).  
* Each sample is quantized into a finite number of amplitude levels.  
* Enables error detection and correction during transmission.  
  **Examples**:  
* CDs, MP3s, and streaming audio files store sound digitally.  
* Digital phones, computers, and modern broadcasting use digital signals.  
  **Waveform**: Step-like or square waveform with defined high and low levels.

### **4\. Key Differences Between Analog and Digital Signals**

| Aspect | Analog Signal | Digital Signal |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Nature** | Continuous waveform | Discrete binary values |
| **Values** | Infinite possible values | Limited finite values (usually 0 & 1\) |
| **Noise Sensitivity** | More susceptible to noise and distortion | Less affected by noise, more robust |
| **Signal Processing** | Complex, requires analog circuitry | Easier with computers and DSP |
| **Storage** | Requires physical medium (tape, vinyl) | Stored in digital media (hard drives, SSDs) |
| **Transmission** | Prone to degradation over distance | Can be regenerated to maintain quality |
| **Bandwidth Usage** | Requires less bandwidth | Requires higher bandwidth |
