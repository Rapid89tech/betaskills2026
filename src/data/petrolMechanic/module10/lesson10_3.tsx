        Flushing removes rust, sediment, and degraded coolant, preventing clogs and corrosion that cause overheating. Old coolant loses anti-corrosion properties after 2–5 years, reducing heat transfer and risking water pump or radiator failure (R5,000–R10,000).

        In South Africa, hard water or poor coolant quality accelerates corrosion in high-mileage vehicles (100,000+ km). Flushing restores cooling efficiency, extending component life by 30–50%.

        Learners will explore flushing in virtual simulations, visualizing sediment removal. Ignoring flushes risks blockages, costing R10,000+ in repairs. Mechanics mastering this skill maintain engine health, critical for vehicles like VW Polos in hot climates.

        The AI voice tutor can explain coolant degradation, flush benefits, or local water quality issues, enhancing understanding. Learners will simulate a flush, identifying rusty coolant and proposing intervals, ensuring reliability for South African clients.

## Tools and Materials Needed

        Flushing requires a radiator flush solution, distilled water, fresh coolant (50/50 mix), a drain pan, funnel, pliers, and safety gear (gloves, goggles). Optional tools include a cooling system pressure tester or bleeder kit.

        Use distilled water to avoid mineral deposits, critical in South Africa where tap water is often hard. Preparation involves cooling the engine and securing a disposal method for toxic coolant.

        Learners will practice setup in virtual scenarios, selecting correct coolant types (e.g., OAT for modern vehicles). Incorrect materials risk corrosion (R3,000+). Mechanics mastering setup ensure effective flushes, saving clients costly repairs.

        The AI voice tutor can explain coolant selection, disposal regulations, or local water challenges, ensuring accuracy. Learners will simulate preparing for a flush on a Ford Fiesta, organizing tools and verifying coolant compatibility, enhancing efficiency in South African workshops.

## Cooling System Flush Procedure

        To flush, drain old coolant via the radiator petcock into a pan, close the valve, and fill with distilled water. Run the engine for 10–15 minutes with the heater on, then drain again.

        For a chemical flush, add flush solution, run the engine per instructions, and drain. Repeat water flushes until clear, then refill with a 50/50 coolant-distilled water mix.

        Bleed air by running the engine with the cap off, squeezing hoses to release bubbles. In South Africa, flushes every 40,000 km prevent corrosion from heat and dust.

        Learners will simulate the process, ensuring clear drainage. Errors like using tap water risk clogs (R2,000+). Mechanics mastering this skill maintain cooling efficiency, saving clients R1,000–R5,000.

        The AI voice tutor can guide learners through bleeding, coolant mixing, or local maintenance schedules, ensuring precision. Learners will practice on a Hyundai i20, verifying leak-free operation, critical for South African vehicles.

## Key Takeaways

        - Diagnosing overheating involves checking coolant, thermostats, pumps, radiators, and fans

        - Replacing components requires proper draining, torquing, and bleeding

        - Flushing removes contaminants, ensuring efficient cooling and preventing costly damage
