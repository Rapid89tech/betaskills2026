### ✅ Brushes

**Detailing Brush:**
Fine-tipped brushes with thin bristles are perfect for intricate designs, fine lines, and detailed artwork. They allow precise control for creating delicate patterns, flowers, and lettering.

**Striping Brush:**
Long, thin brushes designed for creating straight lines, stripes, and geometric patterns. The extended bristles hold more polish, allowing for smooth, continuous lines without reloading.

**Fan Brush:**
Flat, fan-shaped brushes used for creating gradient effects, blending colors, and applying glitter. They're excellent for ombre designs and soft color transitions.

**Flat Brush:**
Wide, flat brushes ideal for applying base colors, creating one-stroke flower petals, and blending techniques. They cover larger areas efficiently and are versatile for various designs.

### ✅ Dotting Tools

**Techniques:**
- Dip the tool in polish and press onto the nail for uniform dots
- Use different sizes to create layered flower petals
