## Purpose of Fuel System Cleaners

https://youtu.be/6eqpczQpzig?si=f8BllWJoke1ssTZT

          Fuel system cleaners are chemical additives that dissolve carbon deposits, varnish, and gum in 
          fuel injectors, intake valves, and combustion chambers, restoring efficient fuel delivery and 
          combustion. They improve fuel economy (by up to 10%), reduce emissions (e.g., hydrocarbons), 
          and prevent clogs that cause misfires or hesitation.

          In South Africa, where fuel quality varies, cleaners like those with polyetheramine (PEA) are 
          essential for preventing injector buildup after 5,000–10,000 kilometres. Learners will explore 
          cleaner effects through virtual simulations, visualizing deposit removal.

          Regular use extends component life, preventing injector replacements costing R2,000 each. 
          Mechanics mastering cleaner use ensure smoother performance and client satisfaction, especially 
          for high-mileage vehicles.

          The AI voice tutor can explain cleaner chemistry, their impact on emissions, or suitability for 
          local fuels, enhancing maintenance decisions.

## Types of Fuel System Cleaners

          Fuel system cleaners include injector cleaners (e.g., Chevron Techron, targeting nozzle clogs), 
          complete system cleaners (e.g., BG 44K, cleaning injectors, valves, and chambers), fuel 
          stabilizers (e.g., STA-BIL, preventing ethanol corrosion), and octane boosters with cleaning 
          agents (e.g., Royal Purple Max Boost, for performance engines).

          Each type addresses specific issues, like injector cleaners restoring spray patterns or 
          stabilizers preventing gumming in stored vehicles. Learners will compare cleaners in virtual 
          scenarios, assessing suitability for South African conditions, where ethanol blends degrade 
          fuel systems faster.

          Using the wrong cleaner (e.g., diesel-only in petrol engines) can damage components, costing 
          R5,000+. Mechanics mastering cleaner selection optimize engine performance and longevity.

          The AI voice tutor can explain cleaner types, their ingredients, or vehicle-specific 
          applications, ensuring informed choices.

## When and How to Use Fuel System Cleaners

          Fuel system cleaners should be used every 5,000–10,000 kilometres or before emissions tests, 
          long trips, or after vehicle storage, especially in South Africa's humid climates where 
          moisture causes corrosion. Add the cleaner to a nearly full tank (per dosage instructions, 
          e.g., 300 ml for 60 litres), drive normally to circulate it, and avoid overuse to prevent 
          engine damage.

          Learners will practice application in virtual scenarios, ensuring correct dosing. For example, 
          using Sea Foam before an oil change prevents crankcase contamination.

          Neglecting cleaners can lead to injector clogs, reducing fuel economy by 10% or triggering 
          repairs costing R3,000+. Mechanics mastering this task maintain efficient engines, enhancing 
          client fuel savings.

          The AI voice tutor can guide learners through dosing, timing, or cleaner selection for specific 
          symptoms, ensuring effective use.

## Benefits of Regular Use

          Regular use of fuel system cleaners improves fuel efficiency (2–10% mileage gains), restores 
          power and throttle response, reduces emissions (e.g., 20% lower CO), and extends component 
          life (e.g., injectors, pumps). They prevent clogs, remove water in ethanol-heavy South African 
          fuels, and ease cold starts in colder regions like the Free State.

          Learners will explore benefits in virtual scenarios, analyzing performance improvements. For 
          high-mileage vehicles, cleaners restore lost performance, saving R5,000+ in repairs.

          Neglecting cleaners risks injector failure or emissions test failures, costing R2,000–R10,000. 
          Mechanics mastering regular cleaner use ensure reliable, eco-friendly vehicles, boosting client 
          trust.

          The AI voice tutor can explain efficiency gains, emissions compliance, or cleaner benefits for 
          older engines, enhancing maintenance strategies.

## Key Takeaways

          Regular fuel filter maintenance, prompt leak repairs, and strategic use of fuel system cleaners 
          ensure efficient fuel delivery, prevent safety hazards, and maintain engine performance. These 
          practices reduce emissions, enhance fuel economy, and extend component life, critical for 
          cost-effective vehicle operation.
