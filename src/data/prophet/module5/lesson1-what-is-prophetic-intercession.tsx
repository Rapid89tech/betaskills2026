# What is Prophetic Intercession?

Prophetic intercession is a dynamic ministry practice where believers stand before God in prayer, guided by the Holy Spirit, to intercede for individuals, churches, cities, and nations. It combines spiritual warfare, strategic decrees, and spiritual insight to align with God's will and advance His kingdom.

> "For Zion's sake I will not remain silent…" — Isaiah 62:6

> Like ancient watchmen, modern prophetic intercessors guard the spiritual realms of influence.

## Characteristics of Prophetic Intercession

### 1. Spirit-Led Prayer

Prophetic intercession is guided by the Holy Spirit, who reveals God's will and prompts specific prayers or decrees (Romans 8:26–27).

**Biblical Example:** Daniel's intercessory prayer for Israel (Daniel 9:4–19) was Spirit-led, aligning with God's prophetic promises.

**Practical Tip:** Seek the Holy Spirit's guidance through prayer and scripture before interceding, ensuring alignment with God's will.

### 2. Spiritual Warfare

This practice involves battling spiritual forces through prayer, proclaiming God's authority to break strongholds or release blessings (Ephesians 6:12).

**Biblical Example:** Elijah's prayers for rain (1 Kings 18:41–45) engaged spiritual warfare, overcoming drought through faith and decree.

**Practical Tip:** Use scripture-based declarations in prayer to confront spiritual opposition, standing firm in God's authority.

### 3. Strategic Decrees

Prophetic intercessors make bold, Spirit-inspired declarations that align with God's purposes, such as decrees for healing, revival, or justice.

**Biblical Example:** Nehemiah's prayers for Jerusalem's restoration (Nehemiah 1:5–11) included strategic decrees for rebuilding.

**Practical Tip:** Declare God's promises over situations, ensuring decrees are grounded in scripture and confirmed by discernment.

### 4. Spiritual Insight

Intercessors receive divine revelation about people, places, or situations, enabling targeted prayers that align with God's agenda.

**Biblical Example:** Anna's prophetic intercession (Luke 2:36–38) was fueled by spiritual insight, recognizing Jesus as the Messiah.

**Practical Tip:** Cultivate sensitivity to the Spirit through fasting and worship to discern God's heart for specific prayer needs.

## Purposes of Prophetic Intercession

1. **Interceding for Individuals, Churches, Cities, and Nations:** Seeking God's intervention for personal needs, church unity, city-wide revival, or national restoration (1 Timothy 2:1–2)

2. **Advancing God's Kingdom:** Aligning earthly situations with heaven's agenda, releasing God's power through prayer (Matthew 6:10)

3. **Engaging in Spiritual Warfare:** Combat spiritual opposition, breaking strongholds and releasing freedom (2 Corinthians 10:4)

4. **Facilitating Restoration and Healing:** Seeking God's mercy and restoration, as seen in Ezekiel 22:30, where God seeks intercessors to "stand in the gap"
