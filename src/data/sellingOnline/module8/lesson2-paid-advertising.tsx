      <h2>Google Ads Search Campaigns</h2>
      <p>
        These campaigns target users actively searching for keywords related to your products or services on Google. You bid on relevant terms, and ads appear at the top of search results, driving high-intent traffic. This format excels for bottom-of-funnel conversions because searchers are often ready to buy, making it efficient for measurable sales growth when budgets in rands are allocated to strong-performing keywords.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Display and YouTube Ads</h2>
      <p>
        Display ads place visual banners across millions of websites in the Google network, while YouTube ads run as video spots before or during videos. Both are excellent for brand awareness and retargeting past visitors. They reach broad audiences cost-effectively in rands, building familiarity and keeping your brand top-of-mind even when users are not actively searching.
      </p>

      <h2>Meta Ads Audience Targeting</h2>
      <p>
        Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram) offer exceptionally detailed targeting based on demographics, interests, behaviours, and lookalike audiences modelled on your existing customers. This precision allows you to reach highly specific segments, making campaigns ideal for building awareness, generating leads, or driving traffic with creative image and video formats that blend naturally into users' feeds.
      </p>

      <h2>Meta Carousel and Collection Ads</h2>
      <p>
        Carousel ads let you showcase multiple products or features in a single swipeable unit, while collection ads open into a full-screen immersive experience. These formats are particularly effective for e-commerce because they highlight product variety and drive direct clicks to your store. They perform strongly on mobile, encouraging exploration and higher engagement rates within controlled budgets in rands.
      </p>

      <h2>TikTok Ads Creative Approach</h2>
      <p>
        TikTok thrives on short, entertaining, authentic video content that feels native to the platform rather than overtly sales-focused. Ads can appear in the For You feed, use trending sounds, or leverage creator partnerships. This format excels at reaching younger audiences and going viral, delivering massive awareness and rapid traffic surges when creative aligns with current trends.
      </p>

      <h2>TikTok Spark and Shop Ads</h2>
      <p>
        Spark ads boost organic creator content, while TikTok Shop integrates direct purchasing within the app. These options capitalise on impulse buying and seamless shopping experiences, turning viewers into buyers without leaving the platform. They are powerful for product launches or trending items, driving high engagement and sales velocity in rands.
      </p>

      <h2>Budget Management Across Platforms</h2>
      <p>
        Set daily or campaign-level budgets in rands on all three platforms, with flexible bidding strategies like cost-per-click or cost-per-impression. Start small to test performance, then scale winning campaigns while pausing underperformers. Smart allocation prevents overspending and maximises return by focusing resources on the platforms and audiences delivering the best results.
      </p>

      <h2>Retargeting and Remarketing</h2>
      <p>
        All three platforms allow retargeting users who visited your site, viewed products, or abandoned carts with tailored ads reminding them to complete their purchase. Remarketing warms up hesitant shoppers and significantly boosts conversion rates, often delivering the highest ROI in rands compared to cold-traffic acquisition.
      </p>

      <h2>Performance Tracking and Optimisation</h2>
      <p>
        Use built-in dashboards plus Google Analytics integration to monitor clicks, conversions, cost per acquisition, and return on ad spend in rands. Regularly review data to refine targeting, creative, and bidding, while A/B testing ad variations. Continuous optimisation turns initial tests into profitable, scalable campaigns that improve efficiency over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Compliance and Best Practices</h2>
      <p>
        Follow each platform's advertising policies on claims, imagery, and targeting restrictions to avoid disapprovals or account issues. Prioritise clear, honest messaging and strong calls-to-action. Adhering to guidelines ensures long-term access to these powerful channels and maintains audience trust while protecting your investment in rands.
      </p>

        <p>
          Paid advertising on Google, Meta, and TikTok offers scalable, targeted reach that complements organic efforts and drives measurable growth in traffic and sales.
