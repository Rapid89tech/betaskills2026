## Role of Engine Oil

https://youtu.be/4AIvbZew_c0?si=YRlm2RrR6-0JYphx

          Engine oil is critical for lubricating moving parts like pistons, crankshafts, and camshafts, 
          reducing friction and wear that could otherwise lead to premature component failure. It also 
          dissipates heat, cooling critical engine areas, and suspends contaminants like metal particles 
          or carbon deposits, preventing sludge buildup.

          Without regular maintenance, dirty or low oil increases friction, causing overheating, accelerated 
          wear, and potential engine seizure. For example, neglecting oil changes in high-performance engines 
          can lead to bearing failure within 20,000 kilometres.

          Learners will explore oil viscosity grades (e.g., 5W-30) through virtual simulations, understanding 
          how they affect performance in varying temperatures. Mechanics mastering oil maintenance can prevent 
          catastrophic failures, ensuring vehicles run smoothly and efficiently, saving clients from costly 
          repairs.

          The AI voice tutor can guide learners on selecting oil grades for specific engines or diagnosing 
          issues like low oil pressure, offering practical insights for workshop applications.

## Checking Oil Levels and Condition

          Checking oil levels ensures the engine has sufficient lubrication to operate safely. On a level 
          surface, after the engine cools, the dipstick is used to assess oil quantity and quality. Clean, 
          amber oil indicates good condition, while dark, gritty, or milky oil suggests contamination 
          (e.g., coolant leaks) or overdue changes.

          Low levels can starve components of lubrication, leading to damage like scored cylinders. Learners 
          will practice dipstick checks in virtual scenarios, identifying issues like metal shavings or water 
          contamination, which could indicate serious problems like a blown head gasket.

          This skill allows mechanics to catch issues early, preventing major repairs. Regular checks, ideally 
          every 1,000 kilometres, maintain engine health, especially in high-mileage vehicles. The AI voice 
          tutor can explain how to interpret dipstick readings or diagnose contamination, ensuring accurate 
          maintenance decisions in real-world settings.

## Changing Engine Oil

          Oil changes, recommended every 8,000–12,000 kilometres or per manufacturer guidelines, involve 
          draining old oil, replacing the filter, and refilling with the correct oil grade (e.g., SAE 10W-40). 
          Warming the engine slightly loosens oil for easier draining, but care must be taken to avoid burns.

          A drain pan collects used oil, and the drain plug must be securely reinstalled to prevent leaks. 
          Overfilling or using the wrong oil grade can cause foaming or inadequate lubrication, damaging 
          components. Learners will simulate oil changes, practicing steps like torquing the drain plug to 
          25–35 Nm.

          This task ensures optimal lubrication and prevents sludge, critical for engine longevity. Mechanics 
          mastering oil changes can deliver reliable services, boosting client confidence. The AI voice tutor 
          can guide learners on oil selection or troubleshooting post-change leaks, ensuring precision.

## Oil Filter Replacement Guide

          The oil filter traps contaminants like dirt and metal particles, ensuring clean oil circulates 
          through the engine. Replaced during oil changes, the filter requires lubricating its gasket with 
          fresh oil to ensure a tight seal and prevent leaks.

          Tightening to manufacturer specs (typically hand-tight plus a quarter-turn) avoids over-tightening, 
          which can damage threads. A clogged filter restricts oil flow, risking engine wear or overheating. 
          Learners will practice filter replacement in virtual simulations, focusing on proper installation 
          to maintain oil pressure.

          Selecting the correct filter for the vehicle's make and model is crucial, as mismatches can cause 
          bypass issues. Mechanics mastering this task ensure clean lubrication, vital for engine durability. 
          The AI voice tutor can explain filter compatibility or diagnose issues like low oil pressure due to 
          a faulty filter, enhancing maintenance accuracy.

## Safety and Disposal Considerations

          Safe oil handling requires PPE like nitrile gloves and safety goggles to protect against skin 
          irritation or splashes. Used oil, classified as hazardous waste, must be collected in sealed 
          containers and disposed of at certified recycling centres to prevent environmental contamination.

          Spills should be cleaned immediately with absorbent materials to avoid slips or fire hazards. Warm 
          oil increases burn risks, so cooling periods are essential. Learners will practice spill cleanup 
          and disposal protocols in virtual scenarios, ensuring compliance with South African environmental 
          regulations, such as the National Environmental Management: Waste Act.

          Improper disposal can lead to fines or ecological harm. Mechanics mastering these practices maintain 
          safe, eco-friendly workshops, protecting themselves and the environment. The AI voice tutor can 
          guide learners on local disposal laws or spill response techniques, ensuring safe practices.
