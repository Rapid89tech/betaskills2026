* **Example**: Use low-voltage LED for pathway lights and solar for the fountain.

## Lighting Design Principles

Effective lighting design balances functionality, aesthetics, and energy efficiency, tailored to the site's needs and landscape features.

### Purpose and Functionality

* **Principle**: Design lighting to serve specific purposes: safety (pathways, stairs), security (perimeter, entrances), or aesthetics (focal points, ambiance).
* **Application**: Use pathway lights for navigation, spotlights for a focal tree, and downlights for a patio dining area.
* **Example**: In the backyard, light the gravel path for safety and the red maple for visual impact.

### Layering Light

* **Principle**: Combine ambient (general), task (specific function), and accent (highlight) lighting for depth and balance.
* **Application**: Use downlights for ambient patio lighting, step lights for task-oriented stair safety, and uplights for accenting plants.
* **Example**: Layer pathway lights (task), patio downlights (ambient), and tree uplights (accent) in the backyard.

### Aesthetic Enhancement

* **Principle**: Highlight design elements (line, form, texture, color) to complement the landscape.
* **Application**: Use soft lighting to emphasize the curve of a path (line), uplight a tree's form, or highlight textured foliage.
* **Example**: Uplight the red maple to showcase its form and illuminate the lavender border for color.

### Energy Efficiency

* **Principle**: Use energy-efficient technologies (LED, solar) and controls (timers, motion sensors) to reduce consumption.
* **Application**: Choose LED fixtures and install a timer or photocell to control operation.
* **Example**: Use solar pathway lights and a timer for low-voltage uplights.

### Light Control and Glare

* **Principle**: Minimize glare and light pollution by directing light precisely and using shielded fixtures.
* **Application**: Angle spotlights away from seating areas, use low-lumen bulbs for ambiance, and shield pathway lights.
* **Example**: Position uplights to avoid glare from the patio seating area.

### Site-Specific Design

* **Principle**: Tailor lighting to site conditions (e.g., soil, climate, plant types) and client needs.
* **Application**: Account for clay soil stability, Zone 7 winters, and client preference for low-maintenance systems.
* **Example**: Use solar lights in sunny areas and low-voltage in shaded zones of the backyard.

## Installation Process

Installing landscape lighting involves planning, wiring, fixture placement, and testing to ensure safety and effectiveness.

### Steps for Installation

1. **Site Analysis and Planning**:
   * Assess the site (e.g., clay soil, Zone 7, 40 inches rainfall) and identify key features (pathways, trees, patio).
   * Create a lighting plan, marking fixture locations and power sources.
   * Example: Plan for pathway lights along a 30-foot gravel path, uplights for a red maple, and downlights for a 10x10-foot patio.

2. **Select Fixtures and Power**:
   * Choose energy-efficient LED or solar fixtures based on purpose (e.g., 300-lumen pathway lights, 500-lumen uplights).
   * Select low-voltage (12V) with a transformer or solar for ease of installation.
   * Example: Use solar pathway lights, low-voltage LED uplights, and downlights with a 300W transformer.

3. **Prepare the Site**:
   * Mark fixture locations with stakes or flags.
   * Check for utilities (e.g., call 811 to avoid gas lines).
   * Example: Mark six pathway light locations along the gravel path and two uplights near the maple.

4. **Install Wiring and Fixtures**:
   * For low-voltage: Trench 6 inches deep for cables, connect to a transformer near a GFCI outlet, and run wires to fixtures.
