# Product Validation (Test Before You Invest)

Validation means proving people will actually buy before you spend serious money on stock, packaging, or ads.

## What validation looks like

- People message you asking to buy
- You get pre-orders or deposits
- A simple landing page collects emails
- Small test ads generate clicks and add-to-carts

## Low-risk validation methods

### 1) Pre-orders

Sell a limited batch and collect payment (or deposits) before production.

### 2) Smoke test landing page

Create a simple product page with price in rands and a "Notify me" or "Reserve" button.

### 3) Marketplace testing

List the product on platforms where demand already exists and measure interest.

### 4) Content-based testing

Post:

- A demo video
- Before/after results
- Customer problem + solution

Track:

- Saves
- Comments
- DMs

## Success criteria

Define a clear threshold, e.g.:

- 20 email sign-ups in 7 days
- 5 pre-orders in 48 hours
- 2%+ click-through rate on a small test ad

If you don’t hit the threshold, adjust your offer (price, audience, angle) instead of buying stock blindly.
