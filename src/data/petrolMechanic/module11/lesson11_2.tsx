        The oil pump circulates oil at 100–400 kPa, lubricating and cooling components like crankshafts and camshafts. A failing pump causes low pressure, leading to wear or seizure (R50,000+).

        In South Africa, high-mileage vehicles (100,000+ km) like Nissan Sentras suffer pump wear from dust and heat. Learners will explore pump function in virtual simulations, visualizing oil flow.

        Ignoring pump failure risks engine destruction in minutes, critical for long-distance travel. Mechanics mastering this knowledge ensure reliable lubrication, saving clients R10,000–R20,000.

        The AI voice tutor can explain pump types (gear vs. rotor), failure signs, or local wear factors, enhancing understanding. Learners will simulate analyzing a failing pump, proposing replacement to maintain engine health, vital for South African workshops.

## Tools and Materials Needed

        Tools include a socket set (10–17mm), wrenches, torque wrench, gasket scraper, drain pan, and optional harmonic balancer puller. Materials include a new oil pump, pickup screen, gasket or RTV sealant, oil (5–6 liters), and filter.

        Preparation involves cooling the engine, disconnecting the battery, and raising the vehicle. In South Africa, dust contamination requires clean workspaces.

        Learners will practice setup in virtual scenarios, selecting OEM-spec parts. Incorrect tools or materials risk leaks (R2,000+). Mechanics mastering setup ensure efficient repairs, critical for vehicles like Toyota Corollas.

        The AI voice tutor can explain tool functions, sealant use, or local dust challenges, ensuring accuracy. Learners will simulate preparing for a pump replacement, organizing tools and verifying part compatibility, enhancing reliability in South African workshops.

## Steps to Replace an Oil Pump

        Drain oil via the pan plug, remove the oil pan bolts (10–13mm), and lower the pan, inspecting for debris. Unbolt the pump and pickup tube, clean mating surfaces, and install the new pump, torquing bolts (10–20 Nm).

        Reattach the pan with a new gasket or RTV, refill with oil, and test pressure (100–400 kPa). In South Africa, pump replacement every 150,000 km prevents failure.

        Learners will simulate the process, ensuring proper torque. Errors like debris contamination risk pump failure (R5,000+). Mechanics mastering this skill restore lubrication, saving clients R10,000+.

        The AI voice tutor can guide learners through torque sequences, priming, or local maintenance schedules, ensuring precision. Learners will practice on a VW Polo, verifying pressure post-repair, critical for South African vehicles.
