# Fulfillment Models (Dropshipping, Stock, Print-on-Demand)

Fulfillment is how your product gets to the customer. Choosing the right model affects your costs, delivery speed, risk, and time required to run the business.

## 1) Dropshipping

With dropshipping, you sell products you don’t keep in stock. When a customer orders, your supplier ships directly to the customer.

### Pros

- Low upfront cost
- No inventory storage
- Easy to test many products

### Cons

- Lower margins
- Less control over shipping times and quality
- Returns/refunds can be complicated

## 2) Holding Stock (Own Inventory)

You buy inventory upfront and store it yourself (at home, a small storeroom, or a warehouse/3PL).

### Pros

- Better margins
- More control over packaging and brand experience
- Faster delivery if you ship quickly

### Cons

- Upfront cost and inventory risk
- Storage and organization required
- Risk of dead stock if items don’t sell

## 3) Print-on-Demand (POD)

Products like T-shirts, mugs, and posters are printed only when you receive an order.

### Pros

- No inventory required
- Great for branded merch and designs
- Easy to offer many variations

### Cons

- Unit cost can be higher
- Quality depends on the supplier
- Shipping times may vary

## Choosing the best model

Pick the model that fits your budget, your time, and the customer experience you want. Many stores start with dropshipping or POD to test demand, then move to holding stock for best-selling items.
