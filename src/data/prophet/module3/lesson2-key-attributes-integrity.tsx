# Key Attributes of Prophetic Integrity

Prophetic integrity is the foundation of authentic prophetic ministry, ensuring that those who speak for God reflect His character and truth. Rooted in biblical principles, prophetic integrity encompasses holiness, humility, truthfulness, accountability, and love, safeguarding the purity of God's message and protecting the church from harm.

> "You will know them by their fruits." — Matthew 7:15–16

## Key Attributes of Prophetic Integrity

### 1. Holiness and Purity

**Description:** Holiness involves personal righteousness and moral discipline, living a life that reflects God's call to be "holy, because I am holy" (1 Peter 1:15–16). Prophets must avoid pride, lust, greed, manipulation, or spiritual abuse, maintaining a life above reproach.

**Biblical Example:** Daniel's blameless character (Daniel 6:4–5) ensured his prophetic visions were trustworthy, reflecting God's holiness despite opposition.

**Significance:** Holiness guards against hypocrisy, ensuring the prophet's life aligns with their message, fostering credibility.

**Practical Tip:** Pursue personal righteousness through prayer, fasting, and scripture study, regularly examining motives to avoid sinful tendencies.

### 2. Humility

**Description:** Humility requires acknowledging dependence on the Holy Spirit, avoiding boasting in revelations, and correcting others gently with love, as Paul modeled (Ephesians 4:15).

**Biblical Example:** Nathan humbly confronted David's sin (2 Samuel 12:1–7), relying on God's guidance rather than personal authority.

**Significance:** Humility ensures prophets seek God's glory, not their own, preventing pride from distorting their message.

**Practical Tip:** Submit prophetic words to the Holy Spirit's guidance and avoid self-promotion, especially on digital platforms.

### 3. Truthfulness

**Description:** Truthfulness means speaking only what God reveals, avoiding fabricated "words" to impress, exaggeration, or emotional manipulation. Prophetic messages must be doctrinally and scripturally sound (1 John 4:1).

**Biblical Example:** Jeremiah spoke God's truth despite opposition (Jeremiah 26:12–15), refusing to dilute or exaggerate His message.

**Significance:** Truthfulness ensures prophetic words align with God's Word, preventing deception and maintaining trust.

**Practical Tip:** Test prophetic words against scripture and seek discernment to ensure they reflect God's truth, not personal agendas.

### 4. Accountability

**Description:** Accountability involves submitting to spiritual leadership, receiving correction, and testing prophetic words to avoid isolation or becoming "untouchable" (1 Thessalonians 5:20–21).

**Biblical Example:** Paul submitted his ministry to church leaders (Acts 15:1–2), ensuring his prophetic guidance was accountable and aligned with the church.

**Significance:** Accountability safeguards against error, ensuring prophetic ministry serves the church's unity and growth.

**Practical Tip:** Establish relationships with trusted leaders to review prophetic messages, fostering accountability and humility.

### 5. Love and Compassion

**Description:** Prophecy must flow from love, not judgment, aiming to edify and build, even when rebuking, as outlined in 1 Corinthians 13:1–2: "If I have the gift of prophecy… but do not have love, I am nothing."

**Biblical Example:** Jesus' prophetic teachings, like the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7), were delivered with compassion, aiming to restore and uplift.

**Significance:** Love ensures prophetic words build up the church, fostering healing and unity rather than condemnation.

**Practical Tip:** Deliver prophetic messages with compassion, praying for God's love to guide words, even in correction.

## Consequences of Lacking Prophetic Integrity

- **Distorted Messages:** Pride or dishonesty can lead to false prophecies, misleading the church
