      <p>
        Financial markets are organized systems where people, companies, institutions, and governments buy and sell financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives. These markets act as the backbone of the global economy by enabling the flow of capital, helping entities raise funds, manage risk, and invest savings for growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        At their core, financial markets serve three primary functions, each playing a critical role in how money moves through an economy.
      </p>

      <h2>Three Primary Functions</h2>

      <h3>Capital allocation</h3>
      <p>
        Companies and governments need funds to expand operations, build infrastructure, or finance projects. Financial markets provide a structured way for them to raise this capital by issuing stocks or bonds to investors who are willing to provide money in exchange for ownership stakes or fixed returns. This process directs savings from individuals and institutions toward productive uses, supporting economic development.
      </p>

      <h3>Price discovery</h3>
      <p>
        Through the constant interaction of buyers and sellers, financial markets establish fair prices for financial instruments based on supply, demand, and available information. This transparent pricing reflects economic conditions, company performance, investor sentiment, and broader risks, giving everyone a reliable benchmark for value.
      </p>

      <h3>Liquidity provision</h3>
      <p>
        Markets allow participants to convert investments into cash quickly and with minimal price impact. This liquidity encourages participation because investors know they can enter or exit positions when needed, whether for personal reasons, rebalancing portfolios, or responding to new opportunities.
      </p>

      <h2>Main Types of Financial Markets</h2>

      <h3>Stock markets</h3>
      <p>
        These are venues where ownership shares in publicly listed companies are traded. Investors buy shares hoping the company grows and the share price rises, or to receive dividends. In South Africa, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is the primary stock market, where major companies list their shares priced in rands, allowing local and international investors to participate in the country's economic growth.
      </p>

      <h3>Bond markets</h3>
      <p>
        Here, debt securities are bought and sold. Governments and companies issue bonds to borrow funds, promising to pay back the principal plus interest over time. Bond markets are essential for long-term financing, and in South Africa, government bonds issued in rands play a key role in funding public initiatives.
      </p>

      <h3>Foreign exchange (forex) markets</h3>
      <p>
        The largest and most liquid financial market globally, where currencies are traded against one another. Businesses, banks, and investors exchange rands for dollars, euros, or other currencies to facilitate international trade, hedge against currency fluctuations, or speculate on exchange rate movements.
      </p>

      <h3>Derivatives markets</h3>
      <p>
        These involve contracts whose value derives from underlying assets like stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities. Common derivatives include futures, options, and swaps, used primarily for hedging risks (such as protecting against adverse price or currency movements) or for speculative purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>Commodity markets</h3>
      <p>
        Platforms for trading physical goods like gold, oil, agricultural products, or metals. In South Africa, commodities such as platinum and gold are particularly significant, with prices often quoted in rands for local participants.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Participants</h2>
      <p>
        Participants in financial markets include retail investors saving for retirement, institutional investors like pension funds and asset managers handling large pools of capital, corporations raising funds or managing treasury operations, banks and brokers facilitating trades, and regulators ensuring fairness and stability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, financial markets promote efficient resource allocation, risk management, and economic growth by connecting those with surplus funds to those who need capital, all while operating under rules that aim to maintain transparency and protect participants.
