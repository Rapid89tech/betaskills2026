# Identifying and Researching Guests

## Why Have Guests on a Podcast?
Bringing in guests can:

- Add credibility and expertise to your show, enhancing trust.
- Expose your podcast to the guest's audience, boosting reach.
- Offer new perspectives and diverse voices, enriching content.
- Make your show more dynamic and engaging, improving listener retention.

Managers leverage guests to align with audience interests, using platforms like Podmatch to connect and promote episodes effectively.

## Part 1: Identifying Potential Guests

Managers prioritize guests who align with the podcast's niche, ensuring engaging, relevant discussions that resonate with listeners.

### Guest Categories by Type
