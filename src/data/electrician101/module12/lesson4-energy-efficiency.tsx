# Energy Efficiency and Green Solutions 🌱

## Energy-Efficient Lighting

### LED Technology
- 75-80% more efficient than incandescent
- Last 25-50 times longer
- Instant on (no warm-up)
- Dimmable options available
- Color temperature options
- Significant energy savings

### Lighting Controls
- Occupancy sensors
- Daylight harvesting
- Time-based controls
- Dimming systems
- Networked lighting control

### Benefits
- Reduce energy consumption
- Lower utility bills
- Less heat generation
- Reduced maintenance
- Improved light quality

---

## Energy Management Systems

### Building Automation
- Centralized control
- Monitor energy usage
- Optimize equipment operation
- Demand response integration
- Energy reporting

### Smart Controls
- Programmable thermostats
- Load shedding capability
- Time-of-use optimization
- Peak demand management

---

## Power Factor Correction

### What is Power Factor?
- Ratio of real power to apparent power
- Poor PF = wasted energy
- Caused by inductive loads (motors)
- Utility penalties for low PF

### Correction Methods
- Capacitor banks
- Active power factor correction
- VFDs improve power factor
- Reduces demand charges

---

## Energy-Efficient Equipment

### HVAC
- High-efficiency units
- VFD-controlled motors

---

## ROI Calculations

### Factors
- Current energy costs
- Equipment costs
- Installation costs
- Energy savings
- Incentives/rebates
- Maintenance costs

### Payback Period
- Simple payback = Cost / Annual Savings
- Consider utility rate increases
- Include all incentives
- Help clients make informed decisions

---

## Green Building Certifications
