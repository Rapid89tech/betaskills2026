# Design, Plan, and Construct a Major Carpentry Project 📐🔨

Designing, planning, and constructing a major carpentry project, such as a custom oak dining table, requires integrating creativity, precision, and technical skills to achieve a functional, durable, and aesthetically pleasing result.

## Principles of Designing, Planning, and Constructing

### Functionality
Ensure design meets practical needs (seating 8 people, fitting dining space).

### Aesthetics
Balance form and finish to enhance visual appeal, aligning with client preferences (modern, rustic).

### Structural Integrity
Use strong materials and joinery to ensure durability under load (100 kg for dining table).

### Precision
Achieve tight tolerances (±1/16 inch) for seamless assembly and professional results.

### Sustainability
Optimize material use and select eco-friendly options (FSC-certified wood, low-VOC finishes).

## Project Overview: Custom Oak Dining Table

**Specifications**: 2.4m (L) x 1m (W) x 0.75m (H), solid oak, seating 8, natural grain finish, water-based polyurethane coating

**Purpose**: A durable, elegant dining table for a family home in Johannesburg

**Budget**: Approximately R30,000 (materials, labor, and overheads)

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (design: 3 days, planning: 2 days, construction: 12 days, finishing: 3 days)

## Steps for Design, Planning, and Construction

### 1. Design Phase

The design phase establishes the table's aesthetics, dimensions, and functionality.

**Techniques**:
- **Client Consultation**: Discuss requirements (seating capacity, style preferences) using sketches or 3D models (SketchUp, R5,000/year)
- **Ergonomics**: Ensure standard dimensions (75cm height, 45cm seat clearance) for comfort
- **Material Selection**: Choose FSC-certified oak for durability (R150–R300 per board meter); water-based polyurethane (R200–R400 per liter)
- **Joinery Design**: Specify mortise and tenon joints for legs and aprons; dovetails for optional drawer
- **Visuals**: Create 3D model showing grain patterns and finish options

**Tools**:
- Tape measure, laser measure (Bosch GLM 50 C, R2,000), SketchUp or Fusion 360, notebook, material samples

**Process**:
1. Meet client to confirm dimensions, style (rustic with visible grain), budget (R25,000–R35,000)
2. Measure dining space; sketch initial design (2.4x1m tabletop, 4 legs 8x8cm, aprons 2x10cm)
3. Create 3D model showing mortise and tenon joints and natural finish
4. Obtain client approval

**Best Practices**:
- Use open-ended questions (e.g., "What style matches your decor?")
- Present multiple finish options (oil vs. polyurethane) with samples
- Confirm design in writing to avoid scope changes

### 2. Planning Phase

Planning involves creating a detailed project roadmap.

**Techniques**:
- **Cut List**: Calculate material quantities (0.05m³ oak for tabletop, 0.02m³ for legs/aprons)
- **Cost Estimation**: 
  - Materials: R15,000 (oak)
  - Labor: 25 hours at R200/hour = R5,000
  - Tools: R500 (consumables)
  - Overheads: R2,000
  - 15% contingency: R3,375
  - 20% profit: R5,075
  - **Total**: R30,950
- **Timeline**: 3 days design, 2 days planning, 5 days cutting/assembly, 4 days joinery, 3 days finishing, 3 days delivery
- **Tool Requirements**: Table saw, router, clamps, sander, chisels, finishing supplies
- **Safety Plan**: OHSA compliance with PPE (safety glasses, N95 mask), dust collection

**Tools**:
- Excel for budgeting, Trello (free) for project tracking, calculator, supplier catalogs

**Process**:
1. Create cut list: 4 boards (2.4x0.25m, 25mm thick) for tabletop, 4 legs (0.75x0.08m), 4 aprons (1.2x0.1m)
2. Source oak from Timbercity (R15,000 for 0.07m³ at R214/m³)
3. Order polyurethane (2 liters at R300/liter = R600)
4. Draft Gantt chart in Trello scheduling tasks
5. Prepare quote for client; secure 50% deposit (R15,475)

**Best Practices**:
- Add 10% material waste (0.007m³ oak, R1,500) for defects
- Verify supplier lead times (3–5 days for oak delivery)
- Include safety protocols in plan (dust collection for sanding)

### 3. Construction Phase

Construction involves cutting, assembling, and finishing the table.

**Techniques**:

*Material Preparation*:
1. Acclimate oak to workshop (6–12% MC, 48–72 hours)
2. Cut boards to size with table saw (2.4x0.25m for tabletop)
3. Plane to uniform thickness (25mm)

*Joinery*:
1. Cut mortises (2x5cm) in legs with router and tenoning jig
2. Cut tenons (2x5cm) on aprons with table saw
3. Dry-fit joints to ensure tight fits (≤1/16-inch gaps)
4. Adjust with chisel or plane
5. Glue joints with Titebond III (R200/liter)
6. Clamp with parallel clamps (100–150 psi) for 24 hours

*Tabletop Assembly*:
1. Glue and clamp tabletop boards edge-to-edge using dowels or biscuits
2. Stagger seams for strength
3. Plane and sand tabletop to 220 grit

*Leg and Apron Assembly*:
1. Attach aprons to legs with mortise and tenon joints
2. Secure with glue and clamps
3. Connect leg assembly to tabletop using corner brackets or pocket-hole screws

*Finishing*:
1. Sand entire table to 320 grit; clean with tack cloth
2. Apply water-based polyurethane (3 coats, 4 hours drying between)
3. Use foam brush; sand lightly (400 grit) between coats
4. Polish with 0000 steel wool for satin sheen
5. Allow 7 days for full curing

**Tools**: Table saw (R10,000–R30,000), router (R3,000–R10,000), tenoning jig (R1,000–R3,000), parallel clamps (R500–R1,500 each), random orbital sander (R1,500–R5,000), chisels, foam brushes, dust collection (R5,000–R20,000)

**Process**:
1. Cut tabletop boards to 2.4x0.25m; plane to 25mm
2. Glue and clamp with biscuits, curing 24 hours
3. Cut legs (0.75x0.08m) and aprons (1.2x0.1m)
4. Rout mortises and tenons, dry-fit, and glue
5. Assemble table, securing legs to tabletop with brackets
6. Check squareness with try square
7. Sand progressively (120 → 220 → 320 grit)
8. Apply polyurethane, sanding between coats; polish for final sheen
9. Inspect for defects; correct with sanding or touch-up

**Best Practices**:
- Use sharp, carbide-tipped blades/bits to prevent tear-out
- Clamp evenly to avoid joint starvation
- Check squareness with diagonal measurements
- Work in dust-free, ventilated area for finishing
- Use low-VOC polyurethane for indoor safety
