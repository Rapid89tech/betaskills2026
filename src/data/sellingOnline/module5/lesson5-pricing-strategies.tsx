# Pricing Strategies (Margin, Value, Bundles)

Pricing is not just “cost + a little extra”. Your price must cover fees, shipping/packaging, and leave enough margin to grow.

## Step 1: Know your true costs

- Product cost
- Packaging
- Shipping (or shipping subsidy)
- Platform fees (payment + marketplace)
- Returns and damage allowance

## Step 2: Set a target margin

Many online stores aim for a margin that allows:

- Profit
- Reinvesting in stock
- Marketing budget in rands

## Step 3: Choose a strategy

### Cost-based

Good starting point, but can underprice if your value is high.

### Value-based

Price based on outcomes and convenience (quality, durability, time saved).

### Competitive positioning

Decide if you are:

- Budget
- Mid-range
- Premium

## Step 4: Increase average order value

- Bundles
- Add-ons at checkout
- Quantity discounts

## Quick rule

If you can’t profit after fees and realistic returns, the product or fulfillment model needs to change.
