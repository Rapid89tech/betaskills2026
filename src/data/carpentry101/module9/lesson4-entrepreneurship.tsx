## Applications in Carpentry

**Furniture**: Setting up workshop for custom furniture, investing in CNC router (R100,000), marketing via Instagram (R30,000 per table quote).

**Cabinetry**: Establishing business with MDF and hardwood capabilities; R10,000/month lease (R50,000 for kitchen project).

## Safety Considerations

- **Workplace**: Safety glasses, N95 masks, hearing protection, gloves, dust collection, fire extinguishers, OHSA training
