# Preventive Maintenance Programs 🔧

## What is Preventive Maintenance?

### Definition
Scheduled inspections, testing, and maintenance performed to prevent equipment failures before they occur.

### Benefits
- Reduces unexpected downtime
- Extends equipment life
- Prevents costly emergency repairs
- Improves safety
- Maintains code compliance
- Reduces energy costs

---

## Preventive Maintenance Tasks

### Monthly Tasks
- Visual inspections
- Check for unusual sounds/smells
- Test GFCI/AFCI devices
- Inspect panel for signs of overheating
- Check emergency lighting
- Test fire alarm system

### Quarterly Tasks
- Infrared scanning of panels and connections
- Check battery backup systems
- Inspect and clean contacts
- Test generator (if applicable)
- Review maintenance logs

### Annual Tasks
- Megohmmeter testing (insulation)
- Torque connections per specifications
- Clean panels and equipment
- Test ground resistance
- Full system inspection
- Update documentation

---

## Inspection Checklist

### Electrical Panels
- Check for proper labeling
- Inspect for corrosion
- Look for overheating signs
- Verify breaker operation
- Check tightness of connections
- Ensure proper working space

### Motors and Equipment
- Listen for unusual noises
- Check operating temperature
- Inspect connections
- Verify proper lubrication
- Test insulation resistance
- Check alignment and mounting

### Lighting Systems
- Replace failed lamps
- Clean fixtures
- Check ballasts/drivers
- Inspect for damaged lenses
- Verify photocell operation
- Test emergency systems

### Grounding Systems
- Inspect ground connections
- Test ground resistance
- Check bonding jumpers
- Verify grounding electrode integrity
- Inspect lightning protection

## Thermal Imaging Inspections

### What to Look For
- Hot spots in panels
- Overheated connections
- Imbalanced loads
- Failing components
- Insulation problems

### Temperature Guidelines
- Connections should be <40°F above ambient
- Hot spots indicate problems
- Document with photos
- Prioritize repairs by severity

---

## Record Keeping

### Maintenance Logs
- Date of inspection
- Items inspected
- Test results
- Problems found
- Repairs made
- Inspector name

### Documentation Benefits
- Track equipment history
- Plan future maintenance
- Justify expenditures
- Demonstrate code compliance
- Insurance requirements

---

## Developing Maintenance Schedule

### Factors to Consider
- Equipment criticality
- Manufacturer recommendations
- Operating environment
- Usage patterns
- Code requirements
- Budget constraints

### Creating Schedule
1. List all equipment
2. Assign priority levels
3. Determine frequencies
4. Assign responsibilities
5. Set up reminders
6. Review and adjust

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- Labor hours
- Testing equipment
- Replacement parts
- Downtime for maintenance

### Benefits
- Avoided emergency repairs
- Extended equipment life
- Reduced energy costs
- Fewer safety incidents
- Better reliability

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Preventive maintenance prevents failures
- Regular schedules more cost-effective than reactive repairs
- Good documentation essential
- Thermal imaging finds hidden problems
- Code compliance requires ongoing maintenance
- Well-maintained systems last longer and operate safely
