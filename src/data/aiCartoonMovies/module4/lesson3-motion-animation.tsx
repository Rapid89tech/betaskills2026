      <h2>Frame Interpolation with EbSynth and DeepMotion</h2>
      <p>
        Frame interpolation is a transformative technique in animation that generates intermediate frames between existing ones to create smoother motion, enhance visual quality, or stylize content. AI-driven tools like EbSynth and DeepMotion have revolutionized this process by automating frame generation while maintaining artistic control and realism.
      </p>

      <h3>Understanding Frame Interpolation</h3>
      <p>
        Frame interpolation involves creating new frames to bridge the gap between two keyframes, resulting in smoother transitions or higher frame rates. This process was traditionally labor-intensive, requiring manual animation or complex software. AI tools now automate this while preserving quality.
      </p>

      <h3>EbSynth: Style-Based Frame Interpolation</h3>
      <p>
        EbSynth is a style-transfer tool that uses AI to propagate artistic styles from a single keyframe across a sequence of frames. It excels in creating stylized animations by interpolating frames based on a reference style.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyframing:</strong> Create a single stylized keyframe (e.g., painted version) that EbSynth uses as reference</li>
        <li><strong>Optical Flow Analysis:</strong> Analyzes motion between frames to ensure style aligns with movement</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Driven Propagation:</strong> Uses machine learning to interpolate style across frames</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Fine-tune results by adjusting style strength or motion sensitivity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DeepMotion: Motion-Based Frame Interpolation</h3>
      <p>
        DeepMotion is an AI-powered motion capture and animation platform that uses machine learning to generate realistic motion data and interpolate frames for fluid animations.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motion Capture Input:</strong> Processes sparse motion capture data or video to track key movements</li>
        <li><strong>AI Motion Synthesis:</strong> Uses deep learning to predict and generate intermediate frames</li>

        <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> Enhance old footage by generating intermediate frames</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI-Assisted 2D/3D Rigging</h3>
