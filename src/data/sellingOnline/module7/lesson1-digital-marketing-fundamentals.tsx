Data-driven decisions allow you to refine strategies, allocate budget in rands more effectively, and continuously improve return on investment.

Sources: Organic, direct, social, referral, paid

Systematically test and improve elements of your website or landing pages—headlines, buttons, forms, or layouts—to increase the percentage of visitors who take desired actions like purchasing or signing up.

Small changes informed by user behavior data can yield significant lifts in results without increasing traffic spend in rands.

### CRO Testing Methods

A/B Testing: Compare two versions to see which performs better

## Mobile-First Approach

Ensure every aspect of your digital presence—website, emails, ads, and content—is fully optimized for mobile devices, as most users now browse on phones.

Fast-loading pages, responsive design, and touch-friendly interfaces prevent frustration and abandonment, directly impacting engagement and sales in a mobile-dominated landscape.

### Mobile Optimization Checklist

- Fast loading speed (under 3 seconds)
- Large, tappable buttons and links
- Simplified navigation
- Mobile-friendly forms
- Readable text without zooming
- Optimized images for mobile
