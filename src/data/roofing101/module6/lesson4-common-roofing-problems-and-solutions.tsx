## Common Problems and Detailed Solutions


* **Leaks/Moisture Intrusion**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Damaged or missing shingles/tiles from wind, hail, or aging (e.g., cracked asphalt shingles after 15–20 years).  
    * Poorly sealed flashing around penetrations (e.g., vents, chimneys) or valleys, allowing water infiltration.  
    * Improper installation (e.g., inadequate overlap of 5 inches for shingles or poor membrane adhesion).  
    * Cracked or degraded sealants exposed to UV radiation or thermal cycling.  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Identify Source**: Use visual inspection, water testing, or thermal imaging to locate entry points (e.g., check valleys, skylights).  
    * **Replace Materials**: Install new shingles/tiles with proper overlap (e.g., 5–6 inches for asphalt shingles) or replace damaged flashing with corrosion-resistant materials (e.g., aluminum, copper).  
    * **Reseal**: Apply high-quality silicone or polyurethane sealant around penetrations, ensuring 1/8-inch thickness for durability.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Install ice and water shields in vulnerable areas (e.g., eaves, valleys per IRC R905.2.7), inspect annually, and ensure proper ventilation to reduce moisture buildup.  
  * **Impact**: Untreated leaks can cause interior damage (e.g., mold, drywall staining), costing $500–$5,000 in repairs.  

* **Ponding Water**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Inadequate roof slope (e.g., <1/4 inch per foot for flat roofs per IBC 1507.10).  
    * Clogged drains or scuppers due to debris (e.g., leaves, dirt) blocking water flow.  
    * Structural settling causing low spots on flat or low-slope roofs (e.g., <2:12 pitch).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Improve Slope**: Retrofit roof with tapered insulation (e.g., polyiso at 1/4 inch per foot) to redirect water to drains.  
    * **Clear Drains**: Remove debris from gutters, scuppers, or internal drains; install strainers to prevent future clogs.  
    * **Add Drainage Points**: Install additional scuppers or downspouts (e.g., one per 10,000 sq ft per IBC 1503.4).  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Schedule bi-annual drain cleaning, use cricket or saddle flashing near penetrations to divert water, and monitor for structural settling.  
  * **Impact**: Ponding water can degrade membranes (e.g., TPO lifespan reduced by 20%) and lead to leaks or structural damage.  

* **Blistering/Bubbling**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Trapped moisture in roofing layers (e.g., wet insulation or underlayment during installation).  
    * Poor ventilation causing heat buildup (e.g., <1 sq ft ventilation per 150 sq ft attic per IRC R806).  
    * Inadequate adhesion in membranes (e.g., TPO, EPDM) due to improper heat welding or adhesive application.  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Cut/Patch Areas**: Remove blistered sections (e.g., cut 6-inch diameter around blisters), dry substrate, and patch with compatible membrane or shingle material.  
    * **Improve Ventilation**: Install ridge vents, soffit vents, or mechanical exhaust to achieve 1:150 ventilation ratio, reducing heat/moisture buildup.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use moisture-resistant underlayments (e.g., synthetic felt), ensure dry materials during installation, and verify ventilation during inspections.  
  * **Impact**: Blisters weaken roof integrity, leading to premature failure or leaks, increasing maintenance costs by 10–15%.  

* **Cracked/Missing Shingles/Tiles**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Wind uplift exceeding material resistance (e.g., asphalt shingles rated for 90 mph failing at 100 mph gusts).  
    * Aging or UV degradation causing brittleness (e.g., asphalt shingles after 15–20 years).  
    * Physical impact from debris or hail (e.g., 1-inch hail causing cracks in clay tiles).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Replace Pieces**: Remove damaged shingles/tiles, replace with matching materials, ensuring proper nailing (4–6 nails per shingle per ASTM D3462).  
    * **Check Surrounding Areas**: Inspect adjacent materials for hidden damage (e.g., cracked underlayment or loosened fasteners).  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use high-wind-rated materials (e.g., Class H shingles for 150 mph winds), inspect post-storm, and replace aging roofs proactively.  
  * **Impact**: Missing shingles expose underlayment, leading to leaks or further material loss, costing $200–$1,000 per section.  

* **Damaged Flashing**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Thermal movement causing cracks or separation (e.g., aluminum flashing expanding 0.013 inches per 100°F change).  
    * Rust or corrosion in non-resistant materials (e.g., galvanized steel in coastal areas).  
    * Poor installation (e.g., insufficient overlap of 4 inches or improper sealing).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Replace Flashing**: Use corrosion-resistant materials (e.g., copper, stainless steel) with 4-inch overlaps and proper fasteners.  
    * **Reseal**: Apply silicone or butyl rubber sealant (1/8-inch bead) around flashing edges.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use compatible materials (e.g., avoid galvanic corrosion with dissimilar metals), inspect annually, and ensure proper installation per NRCA guidelines.  
  * **Impact**: Damaged flashing causes 40% of roof leaks, leading to costly interior repairs.  

* **Sagging Deck**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Prolonged water damage weakening decking (e.g., plywood delaminating after leaks).  
    * Structural overload from heavy materials (e.g., green roofs at 50–150 lbs/sq ft exceeding design capacity).  
    * Inadequate support (e.g., rafter spacing >24 inches for 5/8-inch plywood per IBC 2303.1).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Replace Decking**: Remove damaged sections, install new plywood or OSB (e.g., 5/8-inch CDX plywood), and verify load capacity.  
    * **Reinforce Structure**: Add joists or bracing to meet structural requirements (e.g., L/360 deflection limit per IBC).  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Ensure proper load calculations during design, use water-resistant decking (e.g., treated plywood), and address leaks promptly.  
  * **Impact**: Sagging decks compromise structural integrity, risking collapse and requiring $5,000–$20,000 in repairs.  

* **Gutter Failures**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Blockages from debris (e.g., leaves, twigs) preventing water flow.  
    * Poor slope (e.g., <1/16 inch per foot, causing water backup).  
    * Loose or broken hangers from wind or weight (e.g., ice buildup).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Clean Gutters**: Remove debris and flush with water; install gutter guards to reduce clogs.  
    * **Adjust Slope**: Re-pitch gutters to 1/16–1/8 inch per foot toward downspouts.  
    * **Reattach Hangers**: Secure with corrosion-resistant screws, spacing hangers 24–36 inches apart.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Clean gutters bi-annually, use seamless gutters to reduce leaks, and inspect hangers after storms.  
  * **Impact**: Gutter failures cause water overflow, damaging fascia, siding, or foundations, costing $500–$2,000.  

* **Ice Dams**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Poor insulation allowing heat loss (e.g., R-30 instead of R-49 in cold climates per IRC R806).  
    * Inadequate ventilation trapping heat in attics, melting snow that refreezes at eaves.  
    * Lack of ice and water shields in cold regions (e.g., missing 24-inch barrier per IRC R905.2.7).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Add Insulation**: Upgrade to R-49 in attics to reduce heat loss (e.g., fiberglass batts or blown cellulose).  
    * **Improve Ventilation**: Install ridge and soffit vents for 1:150 ratio to cool attics.  
    * **Install Ice/Water Shield**: Apply self-adhering membrane at eaves and valleys.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use heated cables at eaves, inspect insulation annually, and ensure proper ventilation design.  
  * **Impact**: Ice dams cause leaks and shingle damage, with repairs costing $1,000–$10,000.  

* **Mold/Mildew**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Poor ventilation trapping moisture (e.g., <1:150 ventilation ratio in attics).  
    * Chronic leaks or high humidity (e.g., >60% relative humidity in attics).  
    * Organic debris on roofs (e.g., leaves promoting mold growth).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Improve Airflow**: Add vents (e.g., ridge vents, exhaust fans) to achieve 1:150 ratio.  
    * **Clean Mold**: Use EPA-approved biocides (e.g., bleach solution) to remove mold, ensuring proper ventilation during cleaning.  
    * **Address Moisture Sources**: Repair leaks, install vapor barriers, and dehumidify attics.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use mold-resistant materials (e.g., synthetic underlayment), clean roofs regularly, and monitor humidity levels.  
  * **Impact**: Mold affects indoor air quality and health, with remediation costs of $500–$5,000.  

* **Fastener Issues**  
  * **Causes**:  
    * Thermal expansion loosening fasteners (e.g., nails backing out 1/16 inch per 100°F change).  
    * Corrosion from non-resistant materials (e.g., galvanized nails in coastal areas).  
    * Improper installation (e.g., underdriven or overdriven nails damaging shingles).  
  * **Solutions**:  
    * **Replace Fasteners**: Use corrosion-resistant options (e.g., stainless steel or hot-dipped galvanized nails per ASTM A153).  
    * **Seal Heads**: Apply sealant over fastener heads to prevent water entry.  
    * **Preventive Measures**: Use correct fastener length (e.g., 1.25 inches for asphalt shingles), follow manufacturer nailing patterns, and inspect post-installation.  
  * **Impact**: Fastener issues cause material detachment or leaks, requiring $200–$1,500 in repairs.

  * Conduct bi-annual roof inspections (spring/fall) to catch issues early (e.g., cracked shingles, clogged drains).  
  * Maintain ventilation systems to prevent moisture and heat buildup (e.g., clean vents, check 1:150 ratio).  
  * Use high-quality, durable materials (e.g., 50-year shingles, corrosion-resistant flashing) to reduce failures.  
  * Implement regular cleaning schedules for gutters and roof surfaces to prevent debris accumulation.  
  * Apply protective coatings (e.g., UV-resistant sealants for SPF roofs) to extend material lifespan.  
* **Documentation**:  
  * Record inspection findings, including photos of issues (e.g., ponding water, rusted flashing).  
  * Document repair details (e.g., materials used, labor hours, costs) for warranty claims or portfolios.  
  * Track maintenance schedules to ensure compliance with manufacturer warranties (e.g., 20-year TPO warranty).  
  * Use digital tools (e.g., Procore, Buildertrend) to log repair outcomes and share with clients or supervisors.
