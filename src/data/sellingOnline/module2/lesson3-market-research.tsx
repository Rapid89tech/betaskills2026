# Market Research (Trends, Keywords, Customer Signals)

Market research helps you pick products with real demand and avoid guessing. You look for patterns in what people search for, what they complain about, and what they already buy.

## Start with demand signals

- What questions do people ask repeatedly?
- What problems show up in comments and reviews?
- What products do people keep recommending?

## Use trends and keywords

- Search suggestions on Google/YouTube
- Marketplace search bars (Takealot, Amazon, etc.)
- Trending topics on TikTok/Instagram

Focus on:

- High intent searches ("buy", "best", "where to get")
- Problem searches ("how to fix", "why does")

## Check the competition

- Are there many sellers? If yes, can you differentiate?
- Are prices sustainable in rands after fees and shipping?
- Are reviews complaining about missing features you can fix?

## A simple research checklist

1. Identify a niche
2. Collect 20–50 real customer questions/reviews
3. Confirm people are searching for it
4. Estimate costs + pricing + margins
5. Decide on a clear angle (quality, speed, niche style, bundle)
