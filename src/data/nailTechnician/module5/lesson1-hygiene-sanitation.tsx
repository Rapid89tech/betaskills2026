# Hygiene, Sanitation, and Safety Protocols

Maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation is critical in the nail industry. It protects both you and your clients from infections, diseases, and legal liability. Understanding and implementing strict safety protocols is essential for running a professional, compliant nail business.

## 🧼 1. Understanding Sanitation Levels

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

### ✅ Three Levels of Decontamination

**Sanitation (Cleaning):**
The lowest level of decontamination that removes visible dirt, debris, and some microorganisms from surfaces and tools. This is the first step before disinfection or sterilization.

**Methods:**
- Washing with soap and water
- Removing visible debris
- Preparing items for higher-level decontamination

**Disinfection:**
The second level that kills most (but not all) microorganisms on non-porous surfaces. This is the standard for most nail salon tools and surfaces.

**Methods:**
- EPA-registered hospital-grade disinfectants
- Barbicide solution
- Alcohol-based disinfectants (70% or higher)
- UV sanitizers

**Sterilization:**
The highest level that kills all microorganisms, including bacterial spores. Required for tools that penetrate the skin or come into contact with blood.

**Methods:**
- Autoclave (steam under pressure)
- Dry heat sterilizer
- Chemical sterilants (rarely used in salons)

## 🦠 2. Common Infections and Diseases

### ✅ Bacterial Infections

**Paronychia:**
Infection of the skin around the nail, causing redness, swelling, and pus. Often caused by bacteria entering through damaged cuticles.

**Prevention:**
- Never cut living tissue
- Disinfect all tools
- Avoid aggressive cuticle work

**Pseudomonas (Greenies):**
Bacterial infection that causes green discoloration under nail enhancements. Thrives in moist environments between the natural nail and enhancement.

**Prevention:**
- Ensure proper nail preparation
- Avoid moisture trapped under enhancements
- Remove lifting enhancements immediately
- Never drill through discoloration

---

### ✅ Fungal Infections

**Onychomycosis:**
Fungal infection of the nail plate causing thickening, discoloration, and crumbling. Highly contagious and requires medical treatment.

**Prevention:**
- Disinfect all tools between clients
- Never apply enhancements over infected nails
- Educate clients on proper foot hygiene
- Refer clients to a doctor for treatment

**Tinea Pedis (Athlete's Foot):**
Fungal infection of the feet causing itching, scaling, and cracking between toes.

**Prevention:**
- Disinfect foot baths thoroughly
- Use disposable liners when possible
- Avoid sharing tools between clients

---

### ✅ Viral Infections

**Warts (Verruca):**
Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), appearing as rough, raised bumps on hands or feet.

**Prevention:**
- Do not service clients with visible warts
- Disinfect all surfaces and tools
- Refer clients to a dermatologist

**Hepatitis and HIV:**
Bloodborne pathogens that can be transmitted through contaminated tools or blood exposure.

**Prevention:**
- Use universal precautions
- Disinfect or sterilize all tools
- Never reuse single-use items
- Wear gloves when handling blood

## 🧴 3. Disinfection Procedures

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

### ✅ Tool Disinfection Process

**Step 1: Clean Tools**
Wash tools with soap and warm water to remove all visible debris, oils, and residue. Use a brush to scrub crevices and hard-to-reach areas.

**Step 2: Rinse Thoroughly**
Rinse tools under running water to remove all soap and loosened debris.

**Step 3: Dry Tools**
Pat tools dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry completely. Moisture can dilute disinfectant solutions.

**Step 4: Immerse in Disinfectant**
Fully submerge tools in EPA-registered disinfectant solution (like Barbicide) for the manufacturer's recommended time (usually 10 minutes).

**Step 5: Rinse and Dry**
Remove tools, rinse if required by manufacturer, and dry completely.

**Step 6: Store Properly**
Store disinfected tools in a clean, covered container or UV sanitizer until use.

---

### ✅ Disinfectant Solutions

**Barbicide:**
The most common salon disinfectant, effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Mix according to manufacturer instructions (typically 2 oz per gallon of water). Replace solution daily or when visibly contaminated.

**Alcohol (70% Isopropyl):**
Effective for quick surface disinfection and small tools. Evaporates quickly, so items must remain wet for at least 10 minutes for full effectiveness.

**Quaternary Ammonium Compounds (Quats):**
Hospital-grade disinfectants effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Follow manufacturer's dilution ratios and contact times.

**UV Sanitizers:**
Use UV light to kill microorganisms on pre-cleaned tools. Not a substitute for chemical disinfection but provides additional protection for storage.
