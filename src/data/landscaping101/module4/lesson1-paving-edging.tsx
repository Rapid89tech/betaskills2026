   * Example: Outline a curved edge along a 30-foot lavender border in the backyard.

2. **Excavate**:
   * Dig a shallow trench (3–6 inches deep) along the marked line, depending on material.
   * Example: Dig a 4-inch trench for brick edging along the lavender border.

3. **Install Edging**:
   * Place metal, plastic, or brick edging in the trench, securing with stakes or backfill.
   * For plant edging, space low shrubs (e.g., boxwood) 1–2 feet apart.
   * Example: Lay brick edging upright, securing with soil and sand.

4. **Stabilize and Finish**:
   * Backfill with soil or gravel, compact, and check for level.
   * Example: Backfill the brick edging with soil and tamp down for stability.

5. **Test**:
   * Ensure edging prevents material spread (e.g., mulch stays in the bed).
   * Example: Verify bricks hold mulch in the lavender border.

* **Example**: Install brick edging along the lavender border, laid upright in a 4-inch trench, to separate the border from the tall fescue lawn.
