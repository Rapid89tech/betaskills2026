Before choosing a business idea—or even your training program—do a **Community Scan** to understand what your community needs.

## Steps to Perform a Community Scan:

1. **Observe** what businesses or services already exist. Are they meeting demand?

2. **Identify Gaps:** For example, is there a lack of plumbers, nail technicians, phone repair shops, or electricians?

3. **Assess Quality:** If these services exist, are they good enough? Are people satisfied?

4. **Talk to People:** Speak to men and women of different ages. Get their views on what's needed and what's missing.

**📌 NOTE:** This step is important before choosing your study or skills program. It helps ensure you're learning something **the community truly needs**—increasing your chance of business success.

## Community Scan Questions

When conducting your community scan, ask yourself:

• What services are missing in my area?
• What do people complain about most?
• What businesses seem to be doing well?
• What would make life easier for people in my community?
• What skills or services are in high demand?

This systematic approach helps you identify real opportunities rather than just guessing what might work.`
