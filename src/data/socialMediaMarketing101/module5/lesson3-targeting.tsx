* **Inclusivity**: Avoid biased targeting (e.g., excluding groups based on sensitive demographics).
* **Accuracy**: Ensure targeting data is reliable to avoid misaligned campaigns.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

## Testing and Optimization

* **A/B Testing**: Test targeting segments (e.g., "18-24" vs. "25-34") or ad creatives to optimize CTR (>2%).
* **Metrics**: Track CPC, CTR, conversion rate, and ROI; aim for cost-effective campaigns.
* **Feedback**: Monitor comments or engagement to gauge audience resonance.
* **Refinement**: Adjust targeting based on performance (e.g., narrow to high-converting behaviors).

By leveraging demographics, interests, and behavior in a strategic, ethical manner, brands can deliver relevant, engaging campaigns that align with visual and messaging guidelines while maximizing impact.
