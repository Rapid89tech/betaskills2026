# Key Prophetic Protocols in the Church

Prophetic protocols in the church are biblical principles and guidelines that ensure prophetic ministry—whether through the spiritual gift (1 Corinthians 14:1) or the office of the prophet (Ephesians 4:11)—operates in a manner that glorifies God, edifies the body of Christ, and maintains order.

> "Let all things be done decently and in order." — 1 Corinthians 14:40

## Key Prophetic Protocols in the Church

### 1. Submission to Church Leadership

**Description:** Prophets must submit to pastors and elders, honoring church authority and avoiding rebellion or "lone-ranger" tendencies, even when delivering challenging messages (Hebrews 13:17).

**Biblical Example:** Paul submitted his ministry to the apostles in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1–2), ensuring his prophetic guidance aligned with church leadership.

**Significance:** Submission fosters unity, prevents division, and ensures prophetic words align with the church's vision.

**Practical Tip:** Present prophetic messages to church leaders privately before public delivery, respecting their authority and seeking their discernment.

### 2. Testing of Prophetic Words

**Description:** All prophetic words should be weighed and judged by mature believers, as instructed in 1 Corinthians 14:29: "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said." No one is above accountability.

**Biblical Example:** Agabus' prophecy about Paul's imprisonment (Acts 21:10–11) was received and evaluated by the church, ensuring its validity.

**Significance:** Testing prevents false prophecy and ensures messages align with scripture, protecting the church from deception.

**Practical Tip:** Establish a process where prophetic words are reviewed by elders or mature believers, cross-referencing with scripture (1 Thessalonians 5:20–21).

### 3. Timing and Platform

**Description:** Not every revelation is meant for public sharing; prophets must discern the right timing, platform, and whether a word is for intercession or proclamation.

**Biblical Example:** Daniel received visions that he kept private for a time (Daniel 12:4), waiting for God's timing to share or act on them.

**Significance:** Proper timing and platform prevent confusion and ensure messages are delivered effectively, maximizing edification.

**Practical Tip:** Pray for discernment to determine when and where to share a prophetic word, using intercession for sensitive revelations unless God directs otherwise.

### 4. Respecting Order in Public Worship

**Description:** Prophets should speak one at a time, avoid interrupting preaching or worship, and seek permission before prophesying in public, operating in love and decency (1 Corinthians 14:30–33).

**Biblical Example:** The Corinthian church was instructed to prophesy in turn (1 Corinthians 14:31), ensuring orderly worship that honored God.

**Significance:** Orderly prophecy enhances worship, prevents disruption, and fosters an environment where the Holy Spirit can move freely.

**Practical Tip:** Coordinate with worship leaders to share prophetic words at designated times, ensuring they complement, not interrupt, the service.

### 5. Confidentiality and Sensitivity

**Description:** Prophets must protect individuals' dignity, avoiding public exposure unless God clearly instructs, and deliver messages to restore, not shame, aligning with love (1 Corinthians 13:1–2).

**Biblical Example:** Nathan confronted David privately about his sin (2 Samuel 12:1–7), preserving his dignity while delivering correction.

**Significance:** Sensitivity ensures prophetic words heal and edify, preventing harm or public shame.

**Practical Tip:** Share personal or corrective words privately with individuals or leaders, praying for wisdom to deliver them with compassion.
