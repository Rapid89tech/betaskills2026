# How Turbochargers Enhance Engine Performance 🚀

https://youtu.be/iS0XxIcdcu4

Turbochargers are forced induction devices that significantly boost engine power by compressing intake air, allowing more oxygen into the combustion chamber.

## What Is a Turbocharger?

**Definition:**

A turbocharger is a forced induction device that boosts engine power by compressing intake air, enabling more fuel combustion and enhanced performance.

**Power Enhancement:**
* Increases engine power by 30-50%
* Adds 100-200 hp and 200-400 lb-ft torque
* Saves $1,500 in fuel annually for 100,000 miles
* Improves combustion efficiency to 40-50%
* Critical for diesel trucks and machinery

**Operation:**

The turbocharger is driven by exhaust gases that spin a turbine at 100,000-150,000 RPM, which is connected to a compressor that pressurizes intake air before it enters the engine.

**Key Components:**
* Turbine: Spun by exhaust gases
* Compressor: Pressurizes intake air
* Center housing: Supports bearings and shaft
* Wastegate: Regulates boost pressure
* Intercooler: Cools compressed air
